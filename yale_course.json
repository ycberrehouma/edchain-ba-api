To illustrate some themes, we examine the case of Rickey Ray Rector, executed in Arkansas in 1992. Rector was a black man, who suffered from serious mental deficiencies at the time of his execution.  Then-governor Bill Clinton denied his application for clemency. From race to mental illness to the political nature of the death penalty, Rector\u2019s case contains many elements that will recur in the course. Next, Prof. Bright describes some of the history of race, the death penalty and the criminal courts, including slavery, lynching and the leasing of convicts after the abolition of slavery. Historian Gilbert King describes the case of the Groveland Boys, four young African American men charged with the rape of a white woman in Florida in 1949, who were defended by Thurgood Marshall and other lawyers from the NAACP.  King describes the case based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning book Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys, and the Dawn of a New America, and illustrates it with photographs of the participants in the trial.\n\nIntroduction (s1a) \nA discussion of the topics to be covered in the course including poverty, the right to a lawyer, racial discrimination, mental illness, intellectual disability, and the factors involved in how sentencing decisions are made.\n\nClass Readings:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/s7rcjz1xfv027oa/AADVZYV64AOATmX-FugtINkba/Class%201/Class%201%20Cover%20Page.docx?dl=0",

Georgia.  Five members of the Court found that the penalty was \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, although each of the five justices had different reasons for reaching that conclusion. The other four members of the Court dissented, finding the death penalty constitutional.  Many states responded by passing new death penalty laws.  They took different approaches in trying to eliminate the constitutional defects identified in Furman.  In 1976, the Court ruled on the statutes adopted by five states, holding some of them constitutional and others unconstitutional.  The decisions of the Court in the five cases continue to shape the way death is applied by states and federal government. \n\nChallenges to the Death Penalty Leading to it Being Declared Unconstitutional (s2a)\nThis segment analyzes the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of a challenge to the death penalty based upon a denial of due process in 1971, and it decision in Furman v.

But as we see in this class session, that guarantee is not always upheld. For many years, only those who could afford to pay for lawyers were represented in the cases against them. The Supreme Court recognized a right to counsel in capital cases in 1932, and in cases prosecuted in the federal courts in 1938.  But it was not until 1963, in the case of Gideon v. Wainwright, that the Supreme Court held that the states were required to provide lawyers in felony cases for those who could not afford them. Yet in practice many defendants receive extremely poor legal representation. Here we take up the question of what kind of a lawyer one is entitled to. We look at the right to \u201ceffective\u201d assistance of counsel, the need for expert assistance, and the burdens that face defendants trying to prove that the lawyers assigned to represent them were incompetent and ineffective. We also examine the right of defendants to lawyers after they have been convicted.  The class includes interviews two people who have been involved with reforming the public defender system in New Orleans. Derwyn Bunton, the Chief District Defender for Orleans Parish, discusses some of the challenges public defenders face in providing representation, especially in capital cases, due to limited funding. Stephen Singer, who was involved in a major restructuring of public defense in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, discusses efforts to improve representation and the resistance to it by some judges.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment, Equal Protection and Due Process (s7a)\nThis session examines the right of an accused to a transcript based on the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.  It examines the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision on the right to counsel in Gideon v.Wainwright and the different approaches the federal, state and local governments have taken to implementing the right to counsel.\n\nClass readings: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/s7rcjz1xfv027oa/AABn-YSP45rRYbEGf6os2_NSa/Class%207/Class%207%20Cover%20Page.docx?dl=0  \n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/s7rcjz1xfv027oa/AADht9KNtk4J7OdjFcnr5cA_a/Class%207/Class%207%20Part%201%20Sixth%20Amendment.pdf?dl=0  \n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/s7rcjz1xfv027oa/AADVMhn-XXxSa6t7JSEPdg1na/Class%207/Class%207%20Part%202%20Implementing%20Right%20to%20Counsel.pdf?dl=0  \n\n",

We examine issues of racial bias of judges and the remedies, or lack thereof, for such bias. We also look at a practice peculiar to the United States \u2013 the election of judges in many states. We see how elections can affect judges, and use some examples of televised judicial campaign ads to examine the role of rulings in criminal cases in judicial campaigns. Prof. Bright also talks to Justice Penny White, who served as a Justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court until 1996. Justice White was voted out of office in a retention election after a campaign against her based mostly on the Court\u2019s decision reversing a death sentence. Justice White discusses judicial independence and the influence of interest groups on the justice system. \n\nThe Right to an Impartial Judge (s8a)\nCentral to the rule of law is a fair and impartial arbiter, the judge, who makes decisions based on the law and not personal prejudices, political considerations, or what may be popular at the moment.

The history of the death penalty is closely connected with the history of slavery, lynching, and the oppression and exploitation of African Americans.  There remain significant racial disparities in how the death penalty is applied. This segment examines the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in a case challenging racial disparities in the imposition of the death penalty in Georgia.  The Court rejected the challenge, 5-4, despite rigorous statistical demonstrations of the racial differences in the death penalty\u2019s application.  The question remains of whether there is a remedy for racial discrimination after the decision.  Bryan Stevenson, director of the Equal Justice Initiative, reflects on the Supreme Court decision rejecting the challenge to racial disparities, and offers his insights on the continuing legacy of race discrimination in criminal justice. North Carolina lawyer Henderson Hill discusses findings of racial discrimination made by a North Carolina court under that state\u2019s Racial Justice Act, and the prompt repeal of the Act once discrimination had been shown.\n\nMcCleskey v. Kemp (s10a)\nThe Supreme Court rejected the challenge to disparities in the infliction of the death penalty in Georgia, by a vote of 5-4, despite rigorous statistical demonstrations of the racial differences in the death penalty\u2019s application.  We analyze the Court\u2019s decision, the constitutional basis for it, the viewpoints of the four dissenting justices, and how courts have treated issues of discrimination since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nClass readings: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/s7rcjz1xfv027oa/AAAG7TyZOeBm-OrFVzWCJrmga/Class%2010/Class%2010%20cover%20page.docx?dl=0  \n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/s7rcjz1xfv027oa/AACCwa-86FX-n80nccAjF2Aza/Class%2010/Class%2010%20Racial%20Discrimination.pdf?dl=0  \n\n",

Moore\u2019s is not an innocence case\u2014he pleaded guilty to the crime, a murder committed during a burglary in 1974, and was sentenced to death.  Eight dates were set for his execution and he came within seven hours of execution in 1984 before a court granted a stay.  His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1990.  Despite having been condemned to death, he was paroled the following year and has been a productive member of society ever since.  Moore describes his case, including the legal representation he received, and his time on death row.  Moore describes his relationships with guards, and the feeling of watching his friends being executed one by one, knowing he himself was close to execution.  Moore also describes how he sought forgiveness and developed a relationship with his victim\u2019s family, and touches on his life since release.  The discussion offers an in-depth look at the human face of the death penalty, as we hear the voice of a man who was condemned to death by Georgia.\n\nInterview of William Neal Moore (s11a)\nWilliam Neal Moore, who spent over 16 years on Georgia\u2019s death row and came within hours of execution, describes his experiences, including the legal representation he received, his time on death row, how he sought forgiveness and developed a relationship with his victim\u2019s family, and the commutation of his death sentence and his parole.\n\nClass readings: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/s7rcjz1xfv027oa/AAAu6DHMH8XIH_rq1FSRgaRJa/Class%2011/Class%2011%20Cover%20Page.docx?dl=0  \n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/s7rcjz1xfv027oa/AAChlrRBA2aXDWDOhdxygiCca/Class%2011/Moore%20Willilam%20Neal%20-%20Case%20Study.pdf?dl=0  \n\n",

                "lecture_description": "Mental Health\nMany capital defendants suffer from serious mental disorders that present a number of legal issues \u2013 whether one was \u201csane\u201d at the time of the crime, whether a defendant has sufficient understanding of court proceedings and the ability to cooperate with a lawyer so as to be \u201ccompetent\u201d for trial, whether a defendant is capable of making a decision to enter a guilty plea or give up further appeals even if it means he will be executed, and, finally, whether a person understands the relationship between his execution and the crime committed so that he is \u201ccompetent\u201d to be executed.  We consider some of the difficult questions courts face in making factual determinations of a defendant\u2019s mental state.  We also look at the separate issue of competency for execution.  No one can be executed unless he or she understand the nature of the penalty and its relationship to the crime committed (i.e., that the execution is punishment for the crime), yet the mental health of some who have been sentenced to death deteriorates significantly by the time their execution approaches.  We will look at how courts decide whether someone is \u201ccompetent\u201d to be executed and we will see that sometimes those whose mental awareness is highly questionable are nevertheless put to death.\n\nCompetency for Trial (s12a)\nThis segment examines each of these issues \u2013 the legal definitions set by the Supreme Court or legislatures, the evidence considered in deciding them, whether defendants may be forcibly medicated to make them competent for trial, and whether a \u201cnext friend\u201d can represent the interests of a mentally ill person who wants to give up further appeals and be executed.\n\nClass readings: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/s7rcjz1xfv027oa/AABlfj7xRraYjRTAabZ59NF1a/Class%2012/Class%2012%20cover%20page.docx?dl=0  \n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/s7rcjz1xfv027oa/AADYMwl_fWE5EChB8AMa6dKua/Class%2012/Class%2012%20Part%201%20-%20Mental%20Health%20Issues.pdf?dl=0  \n\n",

A number of people sentenced to death have been exonerated and released.  There are substantial questions about the innocence of others who were executed.  We review those cases and examine the factors that lead to conviction of the innocent.  Next, we turn to the issue of clemency and the vast power of the executive to grant or withhold clemency.  Then we examine executions \u2013 how they are carried out and the questions surrounding lethal injection and botched executions.  Finally, Prof. Bright reviews some different perspectives on the death penalty in America. He talks about why some people oppose it, why some people support it, and where we stand in our long national experiment with the ultimate penalty.\n\nInnocence (s13a)\nA number of people sentenced to death have been exonerated and released.

After talking about finance as an occupation, he emphasizes the moral imperative to use wealth for the purposes of philanthropy, in the spirit of Andrew Carnegie, but also of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. Subsequently, he introduces the guest speakers David Swensen, Yale University's chief investment officer, Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg, former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at American International Group (AIG) and current CEO of C.V. Starr & Co. and of Starr International, and Laura Cha, former vice chair of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong and of the government of the People's Republic of China, and director of the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC).

Subsequent to a historical narrative of the financial crisis from 2007-2008, he turns to the definition of the expected value and the variance of a random variable, as well as the covariance and the correlation of two random variables. The concept of independence leads to the law of large numbers, but financial crises show that the assumption of independence can be deceiving, in particular through its impact on the computation of Value at Risk measures. Moreover, he covers regression analysis for financial returns, which leads to the decomposition of a financial asset's risk into idiosyncratic and systematic risk. Professor Shiller concludes by talking about the prominent assumption that random shocks to the financial economy are normally distributed. Historical stock market patterns, specifically during crises times, establish that outliers occur too frequently to be compatible with the normal distribution. \n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Professor Shiller commences with the history of the first publicly traded company, The United East India Company, founded in 1602. Incorporating also the more recent history of stock markets all over the world, he elaborates on the puzzling size of the equity premium. very high historical return of stock market investments. After introducing the notion of an Efficient Portfolio Frontier, he covers the concept of the Tangency Portfolio, which leads him to the Mutual Fund Theorem.

In order to provide an explicit example from the insurance industry, he elaborates on the story behind American International Group (AIG), from its creation by Cornelius Vander Starr in Shanghai in 1919, to Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg's time as CEO, until its bailout by the U.S. government in 2008. Subsequently, he turns toward the regulation of the insurance industry, covering state insurance guarantee funds, the role of the McCarran-Ferguson Act from 1945, as well as the impact of the Dodd-Frank bill on the insurance industry. He devotes special attention to two branches of the insurance industry--life insurance and health insurance--and emphasizes, among other aspects, the consequences of the health care overhaul in the U.S. from 2010. He discusses the example of earthquakes, with insurance in Haiti and catastrophe bonds in Mexico.

He emphasizes the empirical difficulty to measure the standard deviation, specifically for illiquid asset classes, and elaborates on investment strategies that manipulate the Sharpe ratio. Subsequently, he focuses on the Efficient Markets Hypothesis. This theory states that markets efficiently incorporate all public information, which consequently renders beating the market impossible. For example, technical analysis fails to provide powerful, short-run profit opportunities. A consequence of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis is that stock prices follow a Random Walk, as innovations to the stock price must be solely attributable to news. Professor Shiller contrasts the behavior of a Random Walk with that of a First-Order Autoregressive Process, and concludes that the latter statistical process matches the reality of the stock market more closely. This conclusion, combined with the evidence that investment managers like David Swensen are capable of consistently outperforming the market leads Professor Shiller to the conclusion that the Efficient Markets Hypothesis is a half-truth.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Eugen von Boehm-Bawerk names technical progress, roundaboutness, and time preference as the crucial factors. Professor Shiller complements von Boehm-Bawerk's analysis with two of Irving Fisher's modeling approaches, the view of the interest rate as the equilibrium variable in the savings market and the perspective of simple Robinson Crusoe economies on the determination of interest rates. Subsequently, Professor Shiller focuses his attention on present discounted values and derives the price for discount bonds, consols, annuities, as well as corporate bonds. His treatment of the term structure of interest rates leads him to forward rates and the expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates. At the end of the lecture, he offers insights on usurious loan practices, from ancient times until today, and describes the improvements in consumer financial protection that have been made  after the financial crisis of the 2000s.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Describing the history of mortgage financing, Professor Shiller highlights the historical development of well-institutionalized property rights for mortgage contracts. Subsequently, he focuses on modern financial institutions for commercial real estate, elaborating on Direct Participation Programs and Real Estate Investment Trusts as means for its financing. The distinction between short-term, balloon-payment mortgages before the Great Depression and long-term, amortizing mortgages thereafter shapes the discussion of residential real estate. His discussion of mortgage securitization and government support of mortgage markets centers around Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, from their inception in 1938 and 1970, respectively, to the U.S. government's decision to put them into federal conservatorship in 2008.

Acknowledging impulses to exploit these weaknesses, he emphasizes the role of factors that keep these impulses in check, specifically the desire for praise-worthiness from Adam Smith's The Theory of Moral Sentiments. After a discourse on Personality Psychology, Professor Shiller starts a list of important topics in Behavioral Finance with Daniel Kahneman's and Amos's Tversky's Prospect Theory. The value function and the probability weighting function, as two key components of this theory, help explain certain patterns in people's everyday decision making, e.g. the existence of diamond ring insurance and airline flight insurance. An in-class experiment underscores the prevalence and importance of the concept of overconfidence. Further topics include Regret Theory, gambling behavior, cognitive dissonance, anchoring, the representativeness heuristic, and social contagion. Professor Shiller concludes the lecture with some perspectives on moral judgment in the business world, addressing shared values and integrity.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1: Human Failings & People's Desire for Praise-Worthiness\n11:37 - Chapter 2.

Professor Shiller outlines five different levels of regulation: Regulation on the firm level, on the level of trade groups, on the regional, the national, and the international level. Concerning the first level, he emphasizes the role of the board of directors as the regulators of a company, its duties of care and loyalty, and its responsibilities in the face of tunneling. On the level of trade groups, Professor Shiller presents the history of the New York Stock Exchange from the signing of the Buttonwood Agreement until today. The subsequent description of regional regulation centers on Blue Sky laws during the progressive era of the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th century. On the national level of regulation, he covers the founding days of the Securities and Exchange Commission, its regulation of hedge funds, as well as its efforts against the trading of insider information and stock price manipulation. He complements his coverage of national regulation with the regulatory efforts in the aftermath of the financial crisis from 2007-2008, i.e. the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council and of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by the Dodd-Frank Act from 2010, paired with the European efforts in the course of the European Supervisory Framework, also from 2010. With respect to the fifth and final level of regulation - international regulation - Professor Shiller talks about the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisionand the G-20.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Their survival in so many different historical periods is testimony to their importance. Professor Shiller traces the origins of interest rates from Sumeria in 2000 BC, to ancient Greece and Rome, up to the Song Dynasty in China between the 10th and the 12th century. Subsequently, he looks at banking in Italy during the Renaissance and at the goldsmith bankers in 16th and 17th century England. Banks have survived so long because they solve adverse selection and moral hazard problems. Additionally, he covers Douglas Diamond's and Philip Dybvig's model, which does not only analyze the banks' role for liquidity provision, but also reveals the possibility of bank runs. This leads Professor Shiller to deposit insurance as a means to prevent bank runs. He discusses the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as well as the Federal Savings and Loans Insurance Corporation, together with the role that the latter played during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. The necessity to regulate banks in the presence of deposit insurance results in a discussion of the role of the Basel commission and an explicit calculation to illustrate the core principles of Basel III. At the end, Professor Shiller provides an overview of financial crises since the beginning of the 1990s, with the Mexican crisis of 1994-1995, and the Asian crisis of 1997.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Mr. Greenberg starts his lecture with reflections on his time in the U.S. Army during World War II and the Korean War as well as on his first job in the insurance business as a junior underwriter. Subsequently, after meeting Cornelius Vander Starr, he restructures Starr's failing company The American Home and creates the American International Group (AIG). Factors that have contributed to AIG's success include global diversification through the opening of markets worldwide, the development of innovative insurance products, like political risk insurance and kidnap ransom insurance, and a unique corporate culture that manifests itself in Mr. Greenberg's view of the senior management during his time as a band of brothers. Turning his attention to the early years of the 21st century, he addresses Eliot Spitzer's role in his parting from AIG in 2005 and describes the developments at AIG that ultimately resulted in the government's bailout of the company. He concludes with his personal assessment of the causes of the financial crisis from 2007-2008 and a critical perspective on the role of the government during this crisis. In the following questions-and-answers session, he talks, among other topics, about the insurance industry in China, and shares his views about AIG's current CEO Robert Benmosche and the Dodd-Frank Act from 2010.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Generalizing the discussion beyond futures markets to derivatives markets, he assesses the issue of speculation in those markets and its impact on capitalist activity. Subsequently, he introduces the notions of counterparty risk, standardization of contracts, and clearinghouses within the framework of the first futures market, the market for rice futures in Dojima, Japan. While describing wheat futures, he addresses the price patterns of contango and backwardation, margin accounts that help alleviating counterparty risk, as well as the fair value formula for futures prices. The third commodity futures market is the oil futures market, which leads to description of the history of the oil market in general from the 1870s, to the first and second oil crisis, until the oil price spike in 2008.

Within the framework of the Binomial Asset Pricing model, he derives the value of a call-option from the no-arbitrage-principle, and, as a continuous-time analogue to this formula, he presents the Black-Scholes Option Pricing formula. He contrasts implied volatility, as represented by the VIX index of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which uses a different formula in the spirit of Black-Scholes, with the actual S&P Composite volatility from 1986 until 2010.

Turning his attention to the U.S., Professor Shiller outlines the evolution of its banking system from the Suffolk System, via the National Banking era, to the founding of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. After presenting approaches to central banking in the European Union and in Japan, he emphasizes the federal funds rate, targeted by the Federal Open Market Committee, as well as the recent change to pay interest on reserve balances at the Federal Reserve, enacted by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act from 2008, as important tools of U.S. monetary policy. After elaborating on reserve requirements, which are liability-based restrictions, and capital requirements, which are asset-based, he provides a simple, illustrative example that delivers an important intuition about the difficulties that banks have faced during the recent crisis from 2007-2008. This leads to Professor Shiller's concluding remarks about regulatory approaches to the prevention of future banking crises.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Then, in order to see the essence of investment banking, he  reviews some of the principles that John Whitehead, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs, has formulated. These principles are the basis for a discussion of the substantial power that investment bankers have, and their role in society. Government regulation of these powerful investment banks has been a thorny issue for many years, and especially so now since they played a significant role in world financial crisis of the 2000s.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Following his thoughts about societal changes in a modern and capitalist world, he turns his attention to the fiduciary duties of investment managers. He emphasizes the \"prudent person rule,\" and critically reflects on the limitations that these rules impose on investment managers. Elaborating on different forms of institutional money management, he covers mutual funds, contrasting the legislative environments in the U.S. and Europe, and trusts. In the treatment of the next form, pension funds, he starts out with the history of pension funds in the late 19th and the first half of the 20th century, and subsequently presents the legislative framework for pension funds before he outlines the differences of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Professor Shiller finishes the list of forms of institutional money management with endowments, focusing on investment mistakes in endowment management, as well as family offices and family foundations.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

After a discussion of the difference between brokers and dealers, he outlines the history of securities exchanges from ancient Rome, to the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and Jonathan's Coffee House in London, until the formation of the New York Stock Exchange. He complements this historic account with an overview of securities exchanges all over the world, covering India, China, Brazil, and Mexico. An example of a limit order book allows him to elaborate on the mechanics of trading at the National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation System (NASDAQ). Subsequently, he turns his attention to the growing importance of program trading and high frequency trading, but also discusses their impact on the stock market crash from October 19, 1987, as well as on the Flash Crash from May 6, 2010. When talking about fairness in financial markets, particularly with regard to the relation between private investors and brokers, he discusses the National Market System (NMS), the Intermarket Trading System (ITS), and consolidated quotation systems. He concludes this lecture with some reflections on the operations of dealers, addressing the role of inside information and the Gambler's Ruin problem.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

He gives examples of nonprofits, illustrating how that financial form can support a moral mission and social purpose. There is however sometimes a fine line between for-profit and public enterprises, because similar companies can be either for-profit or non-profit and because governments regulate and collect corporate profits taxes on for profit-organizations, implicitly creating a public purpose for them. Subsequently, he covers state and local finance, outlining the difference between operating budgets and capital budgets as well as the tax-exemption of municipal bonds. During the last part of the lecture, he provides an overview of historic improvement in governmental social insurance that ranges from progressive taxes to public services and to old age, survivors, and disability insurance. All of these advances in public and nonprofit finance have taken place in step with other advances in human society, notably advances in information technology.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

                "lecture_description": "Financial Markets (2011) (ECON 252)\n\nAfter reviewing the main themes of this course, Professor Shiller shares his views about finance from a broader perspective. His first topic, the morality of finance, centers on Peter Unger's Living High and Letting Die and William Graham Sumner's What the Social Classes Owe Each Other. Subsequently, he addresses the hopelessness about the world's future that some see from Malthus' dismal law from the Essay on the Principle of Population, but contrasts it with a positive outlook on purposes and goals in life. While discussing the endurance and survival of financial contracts, he outlines the cases of Germany after World War I, Iran after the Islamic Revolution, and South Africa after the end of apartheid, in which financial contracts prevailed, but does not fail to mention the cases of Russia after the Russian Revolution and Japan after World War II, in which it has not been the case. After a brief comparison between Mathematical Finance and Behavioral Finance, he elaborates on the interplay between wealth and inequality, building on Jacob Hacker's and Paul Pearson's Winner-Take-All Politics, Karl Marx's Das Kapital, and Robert K. Merton concept of the cosmopolitan class. Following this, he emphasizes the democratization of finance as an important future trend and provides examples for this process from his books The Subprime Solution,The New Financial Order and Finance and the Good Society. Professor Shiller concludes the course with advice for finding the right career, highlighting the role of random events, but also the importance of a long-horizon outlook and an orientation towards history in the making.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

        "course_description": "Human Emotion; Professor June Gruber, Yale University\n \nThis course will introduce students to a diverse array of theoretical and empirical issues related to the study of human emotion. Some questions the course will address include: What are our emotions? What purpose do they serve? How do emotions relate to our thoughts, memories, and behaviors towards others? What happens when our emotional responses go awry? Although these questions date back to early philosophical texts, only recently have experimental psychologists begun to explore this vast and exciting domain of study.\nThe course will begin by discussing the evolutionary origins of distinct emotions such as love, anger, fear, and disgust. We will ask how emotions might color our cognitive processes such as thinking and memory, the relationship between emotions and the brain, development of emotions in childhood, and how emotions shape our social relationships. We will also consider how these methods can be applied to studying mental illness in both children and adults. We conclude by studying the pursuit of happiness and well-being, trying to understand what makes us happy.\n  \nThis course is part of a broader educational mission to share the study of human emotion beyond the boundaries of the classroom in order to reach students and teachers alike, both locally and globally, through the use of technology.

                "lecture_description": "Foundations of Modern Social Thought (SOCY 151)\r\n\r\nAn examination of Hobbes's lifetime reveals that the uncertainty of the British monarchy during his life (1588-1679) inspires Hobbes's social and political thought, especially regarding the role of the sovereign to provide for the security of his subjects. We consider the major elements of Hobbes's political and social thought including the state of nature, equality of men, the social contract, the strong sovereign, and legitimate rule. Hobbes's work privileges security of individuals through a strong sovereign but also asserts the right of subjects to transfer their allegiance to a new sovereign if the ruler does not provide for their security; this element of his work in particular and others made him a controversial thinker who was forced into exile for a time. His work has been rediscovered in recent years by economists and other social scientists who see him as the first rational choice theorist.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Locke starts his political theory with a notion of individuals in the state of nature being free, equal and reasonable; the state of nature is not synonymous with the state of war for Locke as it is for Hobbes. Locke argues that states should protect the property of individuals and must govern with the consent of subjects. Unlike Hobbes's strong, unitary sovereign, Locke envisions a separation of the powers of the state into executive, legislative, and federative powers. We examine how Locke's political and social thought assumes an abundance of resources while Hobbes's thought is predicated on an assumption of scarcity.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Working from a perspective that there is a general will apart and above the sum of the opinions of individuals, Montesquieu's work focuses primarily on the law and on manners of governing rather than the question of who governs.  Like Locke, Montesquieu argues that the powers of government should be separated.  Montesquieu's plan of separation between executive, legislative, and judicial powers is what the United States Constitution follows.  Montesquieu asserts that the climate and environment affect men as individuals as well as society.  Although many of his specific ideas seem quite silly now, we must give credit to Montesquieu for being perhaps the first social and political thinker to seriously consider the environment.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Orphaned at ten, he moved in with a woman ten years his senior at sixteen. Their probable love affair is the subject of Stendhal's book Le Rouge et la Noir. Rousseau was friends and sometimes enemies with many major figures in the French Enlightenment. Although he did not live to see the French Revolution, many of Rousseau's path-breaking and controversial ideas about universal suffrage, the general will, consent of the governed, and the need for a popularly elected legislature unquestionably shaped the Revolution. The general will, the idea that the interest of the collective must sometimes have precedence over individual will, is a complex idea in social and political thought; it has proven both fruitful and dangerous.

The general will operates in society when individuals develop not only amour de soi, selfish love, but also amour propre, love of self in relation to others. Rousseau distinguished between bourgeois individuals who have amour de soi and citizens who exemplify amour propre.  In addition to being a political and social thinker, Rousseau is an early and influential education theorist.  In his book Emile, Rousseau argues that individuals are born good but are corrupted by society.  He advocates \"negative education\" which aims at reducing mental errors that students may pick up in society.

One way to reconcile these so-called \"two Smiths\" is that, as social beings, it is in our self-interest to express benevolence and sympathy toward others.

Perhaps most influentially, Mill states that there are not only different quantities of happiness but also qualitative differences in happiness. Humans are capable of higher forms of happiness, and therefore utility must be judged by taking into account quantitative amounts as well as qualitative differences in forms of happiness. Mill also drew a distinction between legality and justice; what is just is not always written in law, and what is written in law is not always just. Justice is a higher principle than the law. Mill's ideas have been incorporated into the laws of the United States and many people who live here subscribe to his ideas; the United States has some of the most permissive laws ensuring the freedom of speech of all liberal, free democracies. However, Mill's argument that liberty must never be sacrificed for expediency has been subject to debate in the United States since 9/11/01. In keeping with his views on liberty, Mill held radical views on women for his time; he believed in educational, political (voting), and marital equality for women. Mill believed women are not inferior by nature. Professor Szel\u00e9nyi ends class by going over how he would answer the questions for the first exam with the students.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The Young Hegelians, a radical group of scholars, intended to subject Hegel's theories to critical scrutiny.  Eventually, Marx breaks with this tradition altogether by saying that alienation does not come from thoughts and therefore cannot be solved by ideas alone.  Alienation comes from material conditions and can only be addressed by changing those conditions.  Due to his radical, revolutionary ideas, Marx was forced to move around Europe quite a bit.  In his lifetime, he saw his predictions about the uprising of the working classes come to fruition in some places, but he also saw these revolutions fail, including the short-lived Commune in France.  Next time, we see how the young Marx who is occupied with Hegelian thought and the concept of alienation transitions to a more mature Marx with the concept of the capitalist mode of production.  \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

In direct contrast, Marx writes that the state only appears to be the universal class.

He responds to Feuerbach with his eleven theses arguing for his own brand of historical materialism.

In the Grundrisse, Marx develops a theory of historical change focused on property relations and ownership.  In addition, he depicts a more complex, multi-linear development of history.  The facet of Marx which he exhibits in the Grundrisse tends not to be the one that is widely remembered, but understanding the nuances he presents there is crucial to fully understand his idea of history and historical change and the role of property in capitalism and Communism.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

He developed these in The Communist Manifesto, the Grundrisse and Das Kapital.  Marx argues that what sets the capitalist mode of production apart from the commodity mode of production is not only the accumulation of money; the capitalist mode of production is characterized by the use of labor power as a commodity to create more value.  The capitalist compensates the laborer enough for his labor power to reproduce the commodity (the labor power), but the laborers' power produces additional value: a surplus value for the owner.  The worker is exploited when he does not keep or control the value created by his own labor power.  Marx argues that the capitalist system forces people into one of two classes: the capitalist bourgeoisie or the proletariat class of wage laborers.  However,  this is not empirically accurate historically or in our contemporary moment; experience has demonstrated that a middle class\u2014including artisans and agricultural workers who control their own labor power and products\u2014that do not fit into Marx's model of the capitalist mode of production.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Each author is different in important ways, but they also agree on two crucial points: we must subject our consciousness and assumptions to critical scrutiny and, along with increasing liberation and rationalization in some ways, modern society also has repressive elements.  Nietzsche is the oldest of these thinkers; he dies in 1900 and stops working a decade before due to mental illness.  While he was ill, his sister, a proto-Nazi and associate of Hitler, cared for him.  Her control of his papers and how they were released to the public painted him as a proto-Nazi himself, but reading his whole oeuvre illuminates that Nietzsche subjected Judaism and Christianity to the same scrutiny.  In The Genealogy of Morals, Nietzsche attempts to use the genealogy method to be critical of modern morality without taking a certain vantage point.  We discuss most specifically his genealogy of the ideas of good and bad and of good and evil.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Nietzsche, Freud and Weber and The Problem of Modernity\n10:23 - Chapter 2.

We discuss Freud's early days in Vienna developing psychoanalysis as a clinical approach alongside Jung, Ferenczi, and others in their tight-knit circle.  They develop the ideas of the id, ego, and superego as well as the antithetical drives, the love drive (Eros) and the death drive (Thanatos).  Later, Freud applies these concepts to society as a whole in his books Totem and Taboo and Civilization and its Discontents.  His argument in Civilization and its Discontents calls to mind Nietzsche; he argues that the repression of urges and drives allows civilization to bloom and flourish, but the same repression is problematic on the level of individual psychology as well as on the level of civilization.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

After he recovered, his work transitioned from enthusiastically capitalist and liberal in the tradition of Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill to much more skeptical of the down-sides of modernization, more similar to the thinking of Nietzsche and Freud.  In his first major work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber argues that the Protestant faith, especially Luther's notion of \"calling\" and the Calvinist belief in predestination set the stage for the emergence of the capitalist spirit.  With his more complex understanding of the causes of capitalism, Weber accounts for the motivations of capitalists and the spirit of capitalism and rationalization in ways that Marx does not.  \n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

We turn to the first way leaders legitimate their authority or domination: tradition.  The primary forms of traditional rule are patrimonialism and patriachialism.  For Weber, the chief difference between these forms of rule is that the patriarch rules without a staff and the patrimonial leader requires a staff that obeys his authority by virtue of personal loyalty and tradition.

Weber borrows the religious term of charisma and extends its use to a secular meaning.  Audiences and followers believe that charismatic leaders have a close connection to a divine power, have exceptional skills, or are exemplary in some way.  Charismatic leaders promise change in the future for the society and also change people's attitudes and values; in this way, charismatic authority is revolutionary in a way that traditional and legal-rational authority are not.  However, charisma is unstable and deteriorates if the leader cannot produce the changes he promises or when he confronts the contradictory logics and demands of the other types of authority.

In feudal times, under traditional forms of authority, monarchs or others in power conferred high status upon individuals and material wealth followed; first a man would be named a nobleman, and then he would get his estate.  In the modern capitalist era, individuals obtain their monetary or material wealth and their class position vis-\u00e0-vis the market determines their life chances.  Weber, in contrast to Marx, argues that class is a modern phenomenon.  However, this does not mean that our modern and contemporary world does not have versions of status.  Like remnants of traditional and charismatic authority co-mingled with legal-rational authority in the state and other institutions, status still determines life chances to a certain extent.  The influence of status is somewhat subsumed under Weber's category of social class.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Remarks for Final Exam\r\n04:06 - Chapter 2.

                "lecture_description": "Foundations of Modern Social Thought (SOCY 151)\r\n\r\nEmile Durkheim, a French scholar who lived from 1858 until 1917, was one of the first intellectuals to use the term \"sociology\" to describe his work.  In the early years of his career, Durkheim's orientation was functionalist (The Division of Labor in Society) and positivist (The Rules of Sociological Method); in the early twentieth century he took a cultural turn and became interested in religion (The Elementary Forms of Religious Life).  Throughout his career, Durkheim was a methodological collectivist, and\u2014unlike Marx and Weber, who were interested in social conflict\u2014was consistently interested in what holds society together.  Durkheim argues in The Division of Labor in Society that the type of social solidarity has changed, due to the increasing division of labor, from mechanical solidarity between similar individuals to organic solidarity based on difference.  Inspired by Montesquieu, Durkheim tracks this change in types of solidarity and change in what he termed the \"collective conscience\" by looking at a shift in law, from penal law focused on punishing individuals to restitutory law based on contract.  Durkheim believed that society would function better if individuals labor at different and complementary tasks with the same vision or goal in mind.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

These abnormal and unhealthy consequences of the change in type of social solidarity have various causes.  Durkheim is best known for arguing that a lack of moral regulation leads to social pathologies, but he also argues that overregulation\u2014in the form of forced division of labor\u2014will lead to fatalism, a kind of anomie.  Anomie resulting from excessive demands on individuals from the market is similar to Marx's notion of alienation, although Durkheim does not use the terms alienation or exploitation.  For Durkheim, anomie is an irregular form of the increasing division of labor and industrialization; it is not internal to the system itself.  Durkheim's optimism about capitalism and his position that people need regulation, similar to Hobbes's conception of human nature, contrast sharply with Marx's ideas.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Durkheim's study demonstrates that what is thought to be a highly individual act is actually socially patterned and has social, not only psychological, causes.  Durkheim's study uses the logic of multivariate statistical analysis, which is now widely used in the discipline of sociology.  Durkheim considered factors including country, marital status, religion, and education level to explain variations in suicide rates.  Durkheim found that Protestants, who tended to be more highly educated, had a higher rate of suicide than Catholics, who tended to have lower levels of education.  Jewish people fell outside of this pattern; highly educated, they had a very low rate of suicide.  Durkheim explained that the education of Protestants led them to individual consciousness whereas the education of Jewish people meant to make them more integrated into their religious community.  Durkheim arrives at a typology of suicide ranging between high and low regulation and high and low integration: egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic suicide.  \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

In The Rules of Sociological Method, Durkheim attempted to provide methodological rules and guidance for establishing social facts and how they are related to one another.  His discussions of methodology represent an early and formative statement about issues that still challenge social science, regarding establishing correlation and causation and the difficulty of assessing the social world objectively without applying subjective judgments to the study.  Durkheim established that the task of sociology is to investigate and examine the sentiments and values of society rather than asserting what is right or correct.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The Persian Sassanid dynasty in the East and various Germanic tribes in the West threatened the Empire as never before.  Internally, the Empire struggled with the problem of succession, an economy wracked by inflation, and the decline of the local elite which had once held it together.  Having considered these issues, Professor Freedman then moves on to the reforms enacted under Diocletian to stabilize the Empire. He attempted to solve the problem of succession by setting up a system of joint rule called the Tetrarchy, to stabilize the economy through tax reform, and to protect the frontiers through militarization. Although many of his policies failed--some within his lifetime--Diocletian nevertheless saved the Roman Empire from collapse.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Introduction and Logistics\n01:35 - Chapter 2.

This process began seriously in 312, when the emperor Constantine converted after a divinely inspired victory at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge. Constantine's conversion would have seemed foolish as a political strategy since Christianity represented a completely different system of values from that of the Roman state, but not only did it prove to be a brilliant storke in aid of Constantine's quest for power, it fundamentally changed the character of the Empire and that of the early Church. Constantine also moved his capitol to a new city he founded in the East, named Constantinople, opening the possibility of a Roman Empire without Rome.

The three major doctrinal concerns of the early Church were the problem of evil, the soul-body distinction, and issues of sin and redemption.  In the Confessions, St. Augustine searches for explanations of these problems first in Manichaeism, then (Neo)Platonism, and finally Christianity.Underlying this narrative are Augustine's ideas of opposition to perfectionism, his exaltation of grace, and the notion of sin as indelible, not solvable.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Professor Freedman considers this transformation through three main questions: Why did the West fall apart -- because of the external pressure of invasions or the internal problems of institutional decline? Who were these invading barbarians? Finally, does this transformation mark a gradual shift or is it right to regard it as a cataclysmic end of civilization? Professor Freedman, as a moderate catastrophist, argues that this period marked the end of a particular civilization rather than the end of civilization in general.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Oringinally the Roman reaction to these invaders had been to accommodate them, often recruiting them for the Roman army and settling them on Roman land. Now, however, they were the rulers of the previously Roman lands of the West. These tribes included the Ostrogoths and Visigoths in Italy, the Franks in Gaul, and the Vandals in North Africa. As most sources about these groups come from the Roman perspective, it's unclear how coherent each group was. In general, the barbarian groups characterized by disorganization, internal fighting and internecine feuds, and lack of economic development. Professor Freedman closes with some remarks on the Burgundian Code as evidence of barbarian society and institutions.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Introduction \n04:48 - Chapter 2.

He begins with a brief overview of Procopius' Secret History, a work which presents a highly critical account of the reign of the emperor Justinian. The more urbanized, economically stronger, and geographically more stable Eastern Empire was able to survive while the West was dismantled by barbarian tribes.  Yet under pressure from its old enemy, Persia, and new threats, the Slavs and Avars in the West and Arabs in the East, the Eastern Empire experienced a decline in the seventh century. Against the background of this political instability, Professor Freedman also discusses the Christological controversies of Nestorianism and Monophysitism which plagued the Church in the East. Beginning in the late seventh century, Iconoclasm also added to the pressures facing the Eastern Church and Empire.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Introduction\n05:11 - Chapter 2.

Procopius's three works -- The Wars, the adulatory Buildings, and the invective Secret History -- are the best sources on the reign of the Emperor Justinian. Under Justinian and his wife Theodora, the Roman Empire reached its height as it reclaimed territories in North Africa and Europe previously lost to the Vandals, Visigoths and Ostrogoths.. However, defeats in war accompanied by heavy taxation led to civil unrest. In addition to the wars, Justinian commissioned a number of large projects like the building of the Hagia Sophia and the organization of Roman law in the Corpus Iuris Civilis. \n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

This history differs markedly from the classical invective style used by Procopius. Gregory of Tours' account seems more random by comparison and emphasizes the intervention of the supernatural in everyday life, particularly through the miracles of St. Martin of Tours. Gregory begins his account by showing how Clovis established Frankish hegemony and secured the prominence of the Franks in the post-Roman West.  That the Franks were the first Catholic (as opposed to Arian) people among the barbarian invaders also figures heavily in his account. Professor Freedman ends the lecture with a discussion of Clovis' sons, among whom Clovis had divided his empire.  Despite their violent internecine conflicts,, Gregory of Tours considers them and their father to be appropriate rulers for savage times.  \n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

In the wake of the fifth century Roman withdrawal, England experienced \"radical economic simplification.\" However, England's conversion to Christianity beginning at the end of the sixth century brought about a flourishing written culture and Latin learning. Ireland experienced a similar cultural flowering, although it had converted to Christianity centuries earlier. It had never been colonized by the Romans, and the Irish Church was less hierarchical, more decentralized, and placed less importance on bishops than did the Roman. The conversion of England under the competeing influences of Rome and ireland was thus not just a conflict between Christianity and paganism, but also between two administrative styles of Christianity.

As it moved west, monasticism shifted away from its eremetic beginnings in Egypt and Syria to more communal way of life under the Rule of St Benedict.  In addition to communal life, the Rule emphasized prayer and labor; the latter of which was interpreted to include reading and eventually the copying of manuscripts.  \n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

He begins with a discussion of its geographical context: the dry desert lands of the Arabian peninsula. The Bedouins, or nomadic Arabs of the region, lived in a tribal society somewhat similar to the Germanic tribes discussed earlier in the course.  Their raids against the Byzantine and the Persian Empire, for lack of strong opposition, would lead to the Arab conquests. The second half of the lecture focuses on the life of Mohammed (570/580 -- 632) and the early years of Islam. Mohammed's revelation was one of the unity of God and a progressive interpretation of God's prophets, with Mohammed as the last of these.  Early Islam was slow to differentiate itself for Christianity and Judaism, though this process accelerated after Mohammed's flight to Medina in 622.

Although they were in some sense religiously motivated, Arab did not attempt to forcibly convert or eradicate Jews, Christians, or other non-Muslims.  The conquests began as raids, but quickly escalated when the invaders discovered that Byzantium and Persia were too weak to withstand their assault. In a relatively short period of time, the Arabs were able to conquer an area stretching from Spain to India.  Against this background of successful conquests, Islam began to experience deep internal divisions. These began as criticisms of the election of Mohammed's successors, but broadened to criticize the Caliphate and the ruling family.  Out of this strife came the division between Sunni and Shiite Muslims.

The Abbasids moved the capitol of the Caliphate to the newly-built city of Baghdad and created a state characterized by a strong administration and well-organized tax system. The state sponsored a cultural flowering, based in part on the translation of classical Greek and Roman texts.

In the second half of the lecture, Professor Freedman considers the seventh century, the crucial turning point in the history of early medieval Europe. The seventh century shaped medieval Europe; the period saw the rise of Islam and Northern Europe, fundamental changes in Byzantium, the reorientation of Persia, and the end of the secular elite in the west.

In the sixth century, under Justinian's rule, the Byzantine Empire experienced a period of expansion (532-565).  However, the Empire was unable to hold on to Justinian's hard won territories and so contracted for over a century of crisis that threatened its survival (565-717).  In the next period, (717-843), the Byzantine army was reorganized and the Empire was able to regain some lost territory.  At the same time, the empire was wracked by the conflicts accompanying theological controversies over artistic representations of the sacred (the Iconoclast controversy).  Finally, with the religious situation smoothed over, the Byzantine Empire was able to expand further from 843 to 1071.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Introduction \n07:34 - Chapter 2.

The Carolingians sought to overthrow the much weakened Merovingian dynasty by establishing their political legitimacy on three bases: war leadership, Christian rule, and the legacy of Rome.  Charlemagne's grandfather Charles Martel won a major victory over the Muslims in 733 at the Battle of Poitiers. Charlemagne's father Pepin the Short allied the Carolingians with the papacy at a time when the latter was looking for a new protector. Charlemagne, crowned emperor in Rome by Pope Leo III in 800, made strides in reestablishing the Roman Empire; although, being centered in northern Europe, his was not an exact imitation of the Roman Empire. Professor Freedman concludes the lecture with the observation that Charlemagne can be considered the founder of Europe as a political and cultural expression.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The period before the Carolingians saw a decline in learning, evidenced in part by the loss of lay literacy. As literacy became the purview of clerics, monasteries set up scriptoria in order to copy manuscripts on a larger scale. In this context, the Carolingians sponsored a revival of learning both for the sake of bringing educated people into the government and in order to encourage the piety of the people.  Professor Freedman ends the lecture by discussing Einhard's writings on Sts Marcellinus and Peter.  Their story illustrates how, in this period, the piety of the well-educated was not all that different from that of the common people.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Increasingly faced with external threats -- particularly the Viking invasions -- the Carolingian Empire ultimately collapsed from internal causes, because its rulers were unable  effectively to manage such a large empire. In the absence of strong social infrastructure and an idea of loyalty to the ruler, government servants strove to make their positions hereditary and nobles sought to set up independent kingdoms. Although it only lasted for a short time, the Carolingian Empire helped shape the face of Europe, especially through the partitions of the Treaty of Verdun which created territories roughly equivalent to France and Germany. \n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The Vikings were highly adaptive, raiding (the Carolingian Empire), trading (Byzantium and the Caliphate) or settling (Greenland and Iceland) depending on local conditions. Through their wide-ranging travels, the Vikings created networks bringing into contact parts of the world that were previously either not connected or minimally so. Professor Freedman concludes the lecture, and the course, by considering what's been accomplished between 284 and 1000. Although Europe in the year 1000 experienced many of the same problems as did the Roman Empire 284 where we began -- population decline and lack of urbanization, among others -- the end of the early Middle Ages also arguable heralds the emergence of Europe and Christendom as cultural constructs and sets the stage for the rise of the West. \n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Professor Shapiro asks students what made them uncomfortable, not only about Eichmann's actions as a Nazi officer, but also the actions of Israel in capturing, extraditing, trying, and executing him. This begs the questions, what makes a government legitimate? And more specifically, was the Third Reich illegitimate and was Eichmann breaking some kind of higher law?

The first tenet of the Enlightenment is a commitment to science as a way of ordering politics, and Professor Shapiro introduces the Cartesian philosophy of science and segues into an elucidation of the workmanship ideal, a central feature of Enlightenment thinking. Corollary to the workmanship ideal, the second tenet of the Enlightenment is the equality of men, ergo an emphasis on individual rights. Does this latter tenet give the basis for the resistance of authority? Throughout the lecture, Professor Shapiro uses a number of primary sources to depict the foundations of Enlightenment thought. Although Locke's thinking is deeply rooted in theology, these topics will reemerge time and time again in different contexts during the course of the semester.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

In his Principles of Morals and Legislation, Bentham outlines the principle of utility; that is, the principle that all men are pleasure-seeking and pain-avoiding. Professor Shapiro presents the case that classical utilitarianism has five characteristics: (1) it is comprehensive and deterministic, (2) it is a pre-Darwinian naturalist doctrine, (3) it is egoistic but not subjectivist, (4) it is highly consequentialist, and (5) it is based on the idea that utility is quantifiable and that one can make interpersonal comparisons of utility. As for the role of government, Bentham believes that it is to \"maximize the greatest happiness of the greatest number.\" The class discusses the merits of utilitarianism through examination of Robert Nozick's hypothetical experience machines, the implication of public goods, and \"the tragedy of the commons.\"\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Professor Shapiro examines the capacity of classical utilitarianism as a radically redistributive doctrine. Bentham himself tried to avoid this consequence with his argument that the rich would burn their crops before giving them away, and he differentiated between \"absolute\" and \"practical\" equality.

It is revealed that the main departure of neoclassical utilitarianism from classical utilitarianism was that it did away with Bentham's troublesome interpersonal comparisons of utility. However, Professor Shapiro explains that, if classical utilitarians didn't take the differences between individuals seriously enough, neoclassical utilitarians take these differences hyper-seriously. If classical utilitarianism can be interpreted as a radically redistributive doctrine, neoclassical utilitarianism becomes the exact opposite; that is, a doctrine that is quite friendly to the status quo. \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

In the end, it turns out to be a doctrine that does not look very similar to Bentham's at all. An important component of Mill's doctrine is his harm principle, which states that the only purpose for which one can interfere with the liberty of action of another individual is self-protection. He also emphasizes free speech because he believes that through the process of argument, one can arrive at truth, which amounts to utility for society. A significant departure from the early Enlightenment, Mill believes in fallibility, and his philosophy of science closely resembles the modern conception. However, there seems to be inconsistency in his application of his libertarian theory where he seems to ignore some types of harm to others. Professor Shapiro reconciles for this by advocating a different, two-step reading of Mill. \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The class discusses such issues as prostitution, free trade, same-sex marriage, statutory rape, Good Samaritan laws, marital rape, discrimination, and tort adjudication (specifically the 1950s case on thalidomide).

Contrary to popular belief, Marx did not hate capitalism but derived from economic analysis that it would self-destruct and lead to socialism.

Ergo, Professor Shapiro asserts that Marx's dialectical materialism is as committed to the two principles of the Enlightenment--basing politics in science and emphasizing individual rights--as utilitarianism. In fact, Marx draws deeply from the Lockean workmanship ideal in formulating his secular labor theory of value, and he was also strongly influenced by classical economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo. Professor Shapiro explains Marx's ideas about natural and market prices, use-value and exchange value, commodification of labor, and alienation.

The central question is, how is wealth created under capitalism at the micro level? For Marx, Adam Smith's invisible hand is not entirely benevolent. His labor theory of value stipulates that living human labor-power is the only way to create new value, and therefore capitalists who shift toward capital-intensive production cannot actually create new value. Marx also assumes wages are at the level of subsistence, and that capitalists turn a profit by exploiting the surplus labor time of workers. Professor Shapiro also explores some corollary concepts to Marx's mode of production--the class-for-itself/class-in-itself distinction, socially necessary labor time and surplus labor time, and the extent to which workers are other-referential.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Although we are dealing with voluntary Pareto transactions, under capitalism, exploitation occurs whether or not an individual is better off. Capitalism is destined to fail, says Marx, because of (1) the possibility for liquidity crises, (2) the nature of capitalist competition inducing declining marginal profit on the industry-wide level, (3) the fact that capitalist competition eliminates competitors and promotes monopolies, (4) weak demand, as workers could not pool their money and buy all that they produce, and (5) the fact that \"workers will come to realize that they have nothing to lose but their chains.\" However, communism (that distribution should be \"to each according to his needs\") can only arise from socialism (\"to each according to his work\"), which in turn can only arise from superabundance created by capitalism.

Certainly, his historical predictions about worker-led socialist revolutions around the world were off-mark. Today, Professor Shapiro presents more of the shortcomings of the Marxian tradition. These include Marx's failure to account for the ability of the state to buttress capitalism and stave off the conditions needed for its self-destruction, the lack of a declining tendency in the economy-wide rate of profit, and the incoherence of a labor theory of value. It becomes clear that the Marxian theory is riddled with holes. However, Marx does leave two important legacies in his wake: a good critique of markets as distributors of either good or harms in society, and a power-based argument about freedom.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Modern social contract theorists replace natural rights with Kant's categorical imperatives, and accept the Aristotelian notion that there is no such thing as pre-political man. They approach the social contract as a hypothetical thought experiment, asking, if there were no state, what kind of state, if any, would people like you and I create? The first modern social contract theorist Professor Shapiro introduces is Robert Nozick, whose theory derives from the voluntary entry of individuals into mutual protective associations in the absence of a state. But he also makes two important points about force: (1) for coercive force to be a good, it has to be exercised as a monopoly, and (2) there's no other natural monopoly. Therefore, a dominant protective association will come out on top and resemble the state. But one problem remains: the incorporation of independents into this state.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

This formulation is not redistributive, nor does it consider rights as goals, but rather as side-constraints on what we can do. In other words, Nozick's is a deontological, not teleological, approach. However, the Achilles' heel of this formulation is the incorporation of independents, based on a system of compensation.  Some people will opt not to enter into our hypothetical social contract, but for the dominant protective association to protect its members from the fear of these independents, they must be forced to incorporate. Nozick thinks that if members could compensate the independents for this rights violation, it would legitimize the state. Unfortunately, no one has ever solved the puzzle of compensation without some interpersonal comparison of utility. But another way to salvage Nozick's account is with the Kantian dictum \"ought entails can,\" meaning that since independents cannot be tolerated, it cannot be an obligation not to violate their rights. But what if the independents could compensate the members for their fear? And couldn't this compensation model be used to justify the welfare state as well? Isn't the value of consent, in which Nozick's account is rooted, completely violated here? \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Evolution of the State without Rights Violations\r\n15:50 - Chapter 2.

Nozick's would respond with his threefold account of justice: (1) justice in acquisition, (2) justice in transfer, and (3) rectification of past injustices. Nozick brilliantly demonstrates that \"liberty upsets patterns\"--even thought we can originally start off with any just distribution, allowing voluntary transactions creates an unequal distribution of wealth. At some point, transactions actually stop being voluntary, however, when some would say the government should step in. But Nozick argues that because there is a deep pluralism of values and we cannot agree on what this point should be, we must keep this redistribution to an absolute minimum as not to impose anyone's views on anyone else.  This is how he distinguishes between redistribution and compensation. His model of compensation is backward-looking and doesn't require us to agree on a pattern. It asks what is necessary to make the harmed person whole again. Although addressing individual harms is easier than looking for a pattern applicable to society as whole, Nozick fails to address the question of how far backward we must look in compensating for past injustices. \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Today, the class is introduced to some of the principal features of Rawls's theory of justice, such as the original position and the veil of ignorance, two of Rawls's most important philosophical innovations. Rawls channels Kant's categorical imperative because he asks individuals who would hypothetically be making choices about the structure of society to consider what would be desirable regardless of who they turned out to be--high IQ or low IQ, male or female, black or white, rich or poor. Rawls does not want to consider utility or welfare, but rather something more concrete--resources. And for him, these resources are liberties, opportunities, income and wealth, and the social bases of self-respect. The first of these leads to Rawls's first principle of justice, which states, \"Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.\" Professor Shapiro animates this principle by asking, \"Should there be an established religion?\" For Rawls, the approach to answering this question is from the standpoint of the most adversely affected person.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

But what if slightly benefiting the least advantaged person comes at a huge cost to others? Professor Shapiro explores Rawls's defense. It is important to note that Rawls is not trying to give marginal policy advice, or even determine whether socialism or capitalism benefits the least advantaged (which he leaves to empirics), but trying to determine the basic structure of society. However, Professor Shapiro shows that the difference principle is not necessarily radical in the redistributive sense when compared with Pareto or Bentham, but it is radical in a philosophical sense. Rawls argues that the differences between individuals are morally arbitrary--it's moral luck that determines the family one is born into, what country one is born in, or one's capacities. However, some of the consequences are unsavory. Although Rawls tries in vain to exclude what one chooses to make of one's capacities, could not effort, or capacity to work, fall into this sphere as well?

Professor Shapiro argues that this is a significant departure from the Enlightenment tradition. In a wrap-up of the class's examination of the Enlightenment, Professor Shapiro charts its evolution from Locke to Bentham to Mill to Marx to contemporary theorists. As for the Enlightenment commitment to science and reason as the basis for politics, the early Enlightenment identified science with certainty, while the mature Enlightenment beginning with Mill emphasized the fallibility of science. But how rational are individuals after all? As for the second Enlightenment normative ideal of individual rights, the efforts to secularize the workmanship ideal after Locke were very problematic, culminating in the numerous and sound critiques of Marx and the intuitively disturbing radicalism of Rawls's moral arbitrariness.

As a traditionalist-conservative, he thinks about social change in a cautious and incremental way and characterizes the social contract as binding on those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are yet to be born. Studying the anti-Enlightenment differs from the study of the Enlightenment because traditional conservatives of the Burkean school reject the idea of formulating a theory upon which to base society. Their views can be more accurately characterized as attitudes or dispositions. Social change is possible, but it must reflect the thinking of \"the man on the Clapham omnibus.\" Thinkers like Burke and Devlin place individuals as subordinate to society and its traditions.

While Burke and Devlin appealed to tradition as the basis for our values, communitarians appeal to the community-accepted values as the basis for what should guide us. Communitarian Richard Rorty criticizes the Enlightenment endeavor of justifying philosophy from the ground up from indubitable premises as a fool's errand and a dangerous mug's game. The main focus of today's class is the communitarianism of Alasdair MacIntyre. Professor Shapiro introduces this school by exploring the symptoms of the problem wrought by the Enlightenment. One is the rise of emotivism and complete moral subjectivism; that is, the abandonment of the instruments for making moral judgments as a consequence of trying to justify philosophy from the ground up. The second symptom is the triumph of instrumentalism and the rejection of teleology, which is actually a coping mechanism for society's deep pluralism of values.

It has two features: (1) man's nature is inherently teleological or purposive, and (2) human behavior is fundamentally other-directed, in that a person's happiness is conditioned upon the experience of others as it relates to him, particularly on the feeling of being valued by someone he values. MacIntyre's account of human psychology also highlights its malleability and its contingency. There is the untutored, or raw, condition, and there is that of having realized one's telos. Ethics are how one evolves from the former to the latter, but MacIntyre notes that ethics are designed to improve behavior, not to describe or aggregate it. Therefore, they cannot be deduced from true statements about human nature; this is his criticism of the Enlightenment project. But he does concede the Enlightenment notion that human beings are capable of thinking critically about purposes and goals. However, this can only come from within a system of norms to have an effect on the people it is intended to influence. Thus, the anti-Enlightenment story subordinates the individual to the practice, to the group, and to the inherited system of norms and values.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

According to him, democracy is the most successful at delivering on the mature Enlightenment's twin promises to recognize individual rights as the ultimate political good and to base politics on some kind of commitment to objective knowledge. And interestingly, democracy as a tradition was not made famous by its champions, but rather by its critics. Today, Professor Shapiro guides the class through the writings of Plato, Tocqueville, Madison, and Dahl. He zeroes in specifically on American democracy and such concepts as tyranny of the majority, factionalism, and checks and balances. \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

What it is about majority rule that confers legitimacy on collective decisions. Is there validity to a utilitarian justification, that catering to the wishes of the majority maximizes the happiness of the greatest number? Does majority rule reflect what Rousseau called the general will? What, even, is the general will? Does Arrow's paradox indicate that the results of voting are arbitrary? Is majority rule just an exercise in realpolitik? Professor Shapiro makes the point that crosscutting cleavages discussed on Monday are the key to unlocking majority rule and limiting the possibility of domination; although one may be in the majority today, the possibility of being in the minority tomorrow prevents tyranny. Several models of democracy are discussed: the public choice model of Buchanan and Tullock, Rae and Barry's critique of Buchanan and Tullock, Schumpeter's marketplace model, the Hotelling-Downs median voter theorem, and Huntington's two turnover test.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

When operationalized as a two turnover test, this conception of democracy proves far from minimalist, yet people often expect other things from democracy, like delivering justice. Although people experiencing injustice under other types of governments often clamor for democracy, they become disillusioned with democracy when a particular regime fails to ensure greater justice for society. However, societies are also unwilling to swoop in with a scheme of justice that has not been democratically legitimated. Professor Shapiro proposes an approach that synthesizes both democracy and justice and pursues them together. His theory of democratic justice has several features which he outlines: (1) it rests on a broad conception of politics, (2) it is semi-contextual, (3) it distinguishes between superordinate and subordinate goods, and (4) embodies two dimensions of democracy, which are (a) collective self-government grounded in the principle of affected interest, and (b) institutionalized \r\nopposition and presumption against hierarchy.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

As applied to governing children, a sphere in which power-based hierarchy is inevitable, he circumscribes the role of the state as the fiduciary over children's basic interests and the role of parents as the fiduciaries over children's best interests. In other words, the state ensures the provision of the resources necessary for survival while the parents provide the resources to enable children to thrive as well as possible. Although some tensions will develop, such dual hierarchies enable a system of checks on these power relationships. And these hierarchies are self-liquidating once the child reaches adulthood, and because of self-determination, the child can no longer be disenfranchised. Professor Shapiro also examines hierarchy in the workplace. If exit costs are high, what he calls a Dickensian nightmare, then increased regulation is justified, but if we are living in a surfer's paradise, with low exit costs and a high social wage, then the firm's pursuit of efficiency should not be impeded. How regulation is applied depends on where the society falls on this continuum. In closing, Professor Shapiro offers his remarks about the staying power and legacy of democracy. \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Glaucon challenges Socrates to defend his claim that acting justly (morally) is valuable in itself, not merely as a means to some other end (in this case, the reputation one gets from seeming just). To bolster the opposing position--that acting justly is only valuable as a means to attaining a good reputation--Glaucon sketches the thought experiment of the Ring of Gyges. In the second half of the lecture, Professor Gendler discusses the experimental results of Daniel Batson, which suggest that, at least in certain controlled laboratory settings, people appear to care more about seeming moral than about actually acting fairly.

Becoming virtuous, according to Aristotle, requires that we engage in a process of habituation by acting as if we were virtuous, just as musicians master their instruments by playing them. By contrast, when one's behavior or experience is out of line with one's reflective commitments, dissonance ensues. Exemplifying this dissonance are Vietnam veterans with PTSD, whose experiences author Jonathan Shay relates to those of the Greek soldiers in the Iliad. In both cases, the reflective commitment to \"what's right\", or themis, is betrayed by some commanding officers; the consequence is a loss of the possibility of social trust.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

This central insight of Aristotle is explored in this lecture. Professor Gendler begins by explaining how Aristotle's method can allow us to turn normative laws - which describe how we should act -- into descriptive laws -- which describe how we do act. But what practical strategies are available to help us turn our reflective behavior (acting as if virtuous) into automatic behavior (being virtuous)?

What's needed, according to Aristotle, is that you knowingly act virtuously for its own sake from a stable character, and do so with pleasure. Professor Gendler turns to Julia Annas's suggestion that Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi's idea of flow may be helpful in  characterizing the condition that you take pleasure in the virtuous act.

Delayed gratification remains the topic of discussion as Professor Gendler shifts to Aristotle's account of weakness of will and contemporary behavioral economics work on hyperbolic discounting. In the final segment of the lecture, drawing on work by Aristotle, Walter Mischel, George Ainslie and Robert Nozick, she presents several strategies for self-regulation: preventing yourself from acting on the temptation, manipulating incentive structures, and acting on principles.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

This is followed by a general discussion of heuristics and biases in the context of risk regulation. In the remainder of the lecture, she introduces two additional puzzles: the puzzle of ducking vs. shielding (which is due to Christopher Boorse and Roy Sorensen) and the puzzle of moral luck. Whereas the ducking/shielding puzzle seems amenable to a heuristic-style solution, the puzzle of moral luck appears to be more profound. The fact that an action can seem more or less morally blameworthy depending on consequences which were entirely outside of the agent's control seems to resist a solution in terms of heuristics, and instead leads to deeper problems of free will and moral responsibility.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Then, the central topic of the lecture, punishment, is presented. After offering a characterization of what civil punishment involves, Professor Gendler discusses various justifications that have been offered of the practice. She distinguishes between justifications that are forward-looking and those that are backward-looking, and between justifications that are primarily victim-directed and those that are primarily offender-directed. These outlooks are then connected to the moral views that have been presented in earlier lectures: Utilitarianism and deontology.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Traditional criticisms of the view are presented, and John Rawls' two-level justification for punishment is offered as one possible way to avoid such criticisms by bringing together consequentialist and deontological justifications of punishment  in a single theory. Next, Professor Gendler reviews some empirical research on punishment intuitions, including data on moral outrage and the \"Knobe effect\".

Hobbes argues that life without a government, in a \"state of nature,\" would be \"nasty, poor, solitary, brutish, and short\" as a result of violent competition for resources. To avoid this situation,  Hobbes contends that rational individuals should lay down some of their rights in order to receive the benefits of a centralized state, to the extent that others are also willing to do so.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

In contrast to Rawls, who puts justice at the center of his theory, Nozick maintains that the primary notion should be rights or liberties. With that assumption in place, Nozick argues that a minimal state is the only just state, and that any state more extensive violates fundamental liberties. Professor Gendler proceeds to introduce and discuss the central elements of the seventh chapter of Anarchy, State, and Utopia: the notions of justice in acquisition, justice in transfer, and the Lockean Proviso.

The first path traces how the course's three main goals were realized: the goals of introducing students to the discipline of Philosophy though a number of central texts; of considering certain central questions raised by those philosophical texts in light of alternative approaches from related disciplines; and of considering more generally the how various disciplines might provide complementary perspectives on important questions. The second path traces how students' understanding of the main course topics---happiness and flourishing; morality; and political legitimacy and social structures--might have changed over the course of the semester. The third path traces the course's main topics in light of three themes that unify the material---the multi-part soul; luck and control; and the relation between the individual and society. And the fourth path looks at the course in light of three three central quotations, from Plato, Aristotle and Epictetus.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Three Goals of the Course \n12:13 - Chapter 2.

Dynamic graphical representation of this trend reveals how improved life expectancies tend to predate increases in wealth. Malthus' \"iron law of wages\" and diminishing returns are explained. Questions about why the industrial revolution occurred in England at the time that it did are then posed. Professor Rae then shows the importance of the \"world demographic transition\" to economic history and contemporary economics. All countries tend to follow similar demographic patterns over the course of their economic development. Countries tend to have high birth and death rates in Phase I, falling death rate and high birth rate in Phase II, falling birth rate to meet the death rate in Phase III, and low birth and death rates in Phase IV. These demographic patterns are associated with different levels of capital and labor. While all countries follow this demographic transition, they do so at different times, and world trade is a way of \"arbitraging\" between different stages in the world demographic transition.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Several preconditions must be met for the invisible hand to work. Markets must be open, and there cannot be just one buyer or one seller who can control product prices. No producer can hold a pivotal private technology, and there must be more or less truthful information across the whole market. Governments must enforce property and contracts.  However, many of these preconditions are at odds with the Porter Forces, which represent general rules of thumb, or principles, for a firm trying to make above average profits. These principles include avoiding direct competition, establishing high barriers to entry, and avoiding powerful buyers and powerful suppliers. Professor Rae suggests that submission to Adam Smith's invisible hand may be contrary to basics of corporate strategy. Corporations can leverage powerful political influence to affect the movements of the \"invisible hand.\" Guest speaker Jim Alexander, formerly of Enron, discusses problems of very imperfect information, as well as the principal-agent problem. Professor Rae also discusses Adam Smith's complicated ideas about self-interest and morality. \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Course Recap\r\n13:19 - Chapter 2.

Both Marx and Schumpeter agree that capitalism is a system that is \"incapable of standing still,\" and is always revising  (or revolutionizing) itself. Professor Rae critiques Marxist determinism and other features of Marx's theories. To highlight Schumpeterian creative destruction, Professor Rae uses examples from technological revolutions in energy production since water-powered mills. Marx's labor theory of value is discussed. Professor Rae highlights aspects overlooked by Marx, including supply and demand for labor, labor quality, and the role of capital in economic growth. Professor Rae also notes problems with Marx's predictions, including the prediction that the revolution will occur in the most advanced capitalist economies.

Professor Rae also highlights Hayek's story of the rock climber who is stuck at the bottom of the crevasse, and discusses whether refusing to assist another is an implicit act of coercion. Hayek's theories of freedom are applied to modern cases of extreme poverty in developing countries.

The leaders of Enron, Mr. Alexander asserts, disregarded concerns over the company's ethics. Enron strategically found and exploited loopholes in accounting regulations to make their transactions as opaque as possible. Lack of regulation and oversight allowed Enron's traders to inflate their numbers. Organizations that were in a position to oversee Enron's operations sometimes faced grossly misaligned incentives that rewarded negligence.

Professor Goetzmann begins with a discussion on debt slavery in the ancient world, and moves on to real estate financing in New York City. Professor Goetzmann also presents recent research by himself and others on the collapse of the real estate market. He explores the notion that the collapse of the mortgage market followed from the fallout of the larger financial crisis, rather than the other way around. Data on the real estate market is presented and discussed. Larger claims about responsibility of different players for the economic crisis are briefly assessed.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The discussion begins with the Coase Theorem, which outlines three conditions for efficient transactions: 1) clear entitlements to property, 2) transparency, and 3) low transaction costs. Professor Rae then tells the story of a whaling law case from 1881 to highlight the power of incentives and property rights. The conversation then moves to Hernando de Soto's portrayal of the development of property rights in the American West, and then shifts to a discussion of New Haven deeds, property values, and valuation of real estate.

Gregory Clark's theory of the causes of the Industrial Revolution, including England's \"downward social mobility\" in the medieval and early modern periods, are explored. According to this theory, the upper classes produced children in greater numbers than in other countries, and there were fewer jobs of high social status. This led to upper class children working in \"lower class\" jobs, infusing lower economic strata with upper class outlooks toward work. Clark also touches on a genetic, Darwinian explanation for England's Industrial Revolution. Professor Rae also discusses other causal explanations for the Industrial revolution, including exogenous and endogenous growth theories, institutions, and Schumpeter's theory of creative destruction.

Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda believes that the Quixote is about the effect that literature has on its readers and about the creation of literature. Its story does not belong to any previous tradition but it is a new story, and this act of invention by a fifty-year old man, Cervantes, is in itself part of modern literature. Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda comments on why the creation of this work was possible in the Spain of the seventeenth century and, after making some important distinctions between the concepts novel and romance, chivalric romances and courtly romance, explains that the Quixote is the first novel because it portrays the clash between the protagonist and his setting for the first time. He then talks about the Quixote's precursors in the picaresque novel and the beginnings of realism. The lecture ends with a thorough commentary on the prologue, its intentions and meanings, along with the concepts of authorship, the legitimation of literature, and ultimately, self invention.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The main character is, as it is suggested in the famous first sentence of the book, beyond family and social determinisms, hence literature appears as a realm for wit and a capacity for invention, breaking with the previous literary tradition and with its predecessors. Perspectivism is expressed in the novel through various linguistic fluctuations, regional differences, and spaces such as the inn, which becomes a key place in the novel by providing an archaeology of society. The first episodes of the Quixote, from the first sally to the first adventure with Sancho, show the gap between literature and reality by probing into Don Quixote's very particular madness which refuses to recognize and accept social conventions. Cervantes' literary techniques, such as dialogue, and the presence of his squire blur the differences between fiction and reality, and ultimately question our beliefs and view of the world.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The first is based upon several levels of narratives that distance Cervantes from his own creation. He does so as the painter Diego Vel\u00e1zquez in Las Meninas which shows multiple incomplete perspectives of the same work, portrays the work behind the scenes of creation, it includes the viewer in the painting as well as the author, as another character, not in a central position, but in an oblique one. With their techniques, both Cervantes and Vel\u00e1zquez present the limitations of human knowledge. The madness of Don Quijote is present in the two episodes that Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda comments upon afterward. The episode with the goatherds connects the ideal world (inside the hidalgo's mind) and the real world of the goatherds. Their human kindness becomes a human quality in the novel displayed by many regardless of social origin. The story of Marcela and Gris\u00f3stomo follows. Here Cervantes portrays their socio-economic world while at the same time he defends their free will above everything else.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The episodes at the inn are an instance of the social being subverted by erotic desire and they show the subconscious of literature. Then follows a commentary on the characters that appear in the episode, all drawn from the picaresque and the juridical documents of the period, and many of whom are marked by a physical defect that makes them unique and yet attractive, even if ugly. Don Quixote's and Sancho's bodily evacuations dramatize the violent forces behind their basic drives to live; the ramshackle improvised architecture of the inn symbolizes the apparently improvised design of the novel, yet, like the inn, it has cosmic connections.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Mambrino's helmet exemplifies the modern radical doubt about the power of the senses to grasp reality, while the episode of the galley slaves represents a satire of autobiographical writing. Cervantes portrays a society that the sixteenth-century reader recognized as his own, in which Gin\u00e9s de Pasamonte, a low-class slippery criminal and author, represents the new generation of writers who break with the strictures of Renaissance mimesis. The descent in social status of the author, Gin\u00e9s, appears to be accompanied by an increase in inventiveness and a rise in the importance of the author. This episode is a meditation on the creation of new genres, such as the picturesque, not derived from the classics but from experience, as well as on the topic of perspectivism.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

This is a new model of conflictive being, capable of seeing simultaneously in two ways. The character among the galley slaves that he calls \"the prisoner of sex\" follows. Professor Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda shows how Cervantes can create a complex character in just one paragraph while portraying the historical and legal background of Cervantes' time. The Sierra Morena episodes, the core of part one of the Quixote, take the second half of the lecture. They consist of a set of narrative strands tightly woven around two of the principal drives in the book: Don Quixote's love quest for Dulcinea, and the series of crimes and misdemeanors perpetrated by the hidalgo and his squire. All the interpolated stories have common elements with the central plot, with the Marcela and Gris\u00f3stomo interlude, and with each other: the perpetration of offenses due to passion, honor, body and property, and with the resulting need for restitution, recompense, requital, pardon or revenge. In all of them, marriage looms as the inevitable and most appropriate form of reparation as well as the most effective kind of narrative closure.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The stories invented by the characters, who create meta-characters, lead to the revelation of other stories not being told, or being told obliquely. The relation among all the stories, including the main plot, is predicated on cuts and crisscrossing made possible by traumatic interruptions, which jostle the memory of the tellers and drive them to reveal other stories behind the one they tell, and making them disclose their inner thoughts. Memory is in all cases the key element a repository of recollections from the past and the structuring force of the self in the present. The whole network of stories, itself a superb display of narrative skill and variety, is one of the aims of Renaissance art, announced by the scene in which Dorotea is ogled (in parts) by other characters. As Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda explains, the Quixote leads us again to ask questions that are pertinent and relevant to our lives. Is living the acting out of roles? Are we characters in somebody else's fiction, and if so, are we bound by ethics?\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1. The Function of Memory in the Development of Characters\r\n08:57 - Chapter 2.

                "lecture_description": "Cervantes' Don Quixote (SPAN 300)\r\n\r\nThe insertion of the Novel of the Curious Impertinent at the end of part one of the Quixote may be explained by Cervantes' intention of meshing both the forms of the chivalric romance and of the collection of Italian novelle. The result, though awkward, leads to the creation of the modern novel. This short novel seems to have been included by Cervantes as a way to publishing it in the same way.. Reading the novel out loud, with all the characters gathered connects with the old tradition of reading literature out loud. The irony, however, is that this perverse love story is heard in the voice of the priest. Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda interprets the novel trough Ren\u00e9 Girard's theory of love always mediated by a third person who also works as a motivator. The story gives a contrasting mirror of literature to the young people at the inn who are involved in love stories about to culminate in marriage. Don Quixote's interruption of the reading allows the court-like scene of reconciliations among the various couples and all restitutions which were made, as a reaffirmation of new social forms. Cervantes' point is that mental life is made up of levels that mirror and distort each other.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1. The Insertion of The Novel of the Curious Impertinent\r\n20:18 - Chapter 2.

Don Quixote's insanity not only gives him a certain transcendence, but also shows the arbitrariness of laws, which causes their rejection by society and other characters' insane behavior. Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda comments on the intersection between literature and history before moving on to the captive's tale, the culmination of those intertwined stories, in which religious conversion overcomes social barriers and transcends the neo-platonic convergence of opposites in Renaissance plots. With his creation of Don Quixote, the first hero-fugitive from justice in the Western tradition--a \"highway robber,\" as the officer of the Holy Brotherhood calls him--Cervantes has created the first important novelistic protagonist drawn from the legal archives. His is the case of the insane hidalgo who set out to act out chivalric fantasies and in the process committed a series of crimes. And yet, he is the agent of Providence.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Probably because it represents a difficult process (since the Quixote is not an ordinary story with a clear beginning) the end is already contained in the prologue, which also works as an epilogue echoing the characteristics of the meta-novel. With this in mind, Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda comments on episodes that constitute partial endings: the caging of Don Quixote, and the prophecy contrived by the barber foretelling a possible ending for Don Quixote's fantasies. The conversation among Don Quixote, the priest and the canon of Toledo, who ironically is the \"idle reader\" from the prologue and a critic of chivalric romances, explores the multiple possibilities of the romances of chivalry, which Cervantes follows in his novel, with the Poetics of Aristotle in the background. The episode is also a critique of Lope de Vega and his innovative plays. Here is one of the great ironies in literary history: that Cervantes, while being wildly original in narrative fiction, was exceedingly conservative in the theater. Don Quixote's arrival at his village has made him madder; it is now the space of the uncanny and the unfamiliar.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Bringing a Meta-Novel to a Close\r\n07:17 - Chapter 2.

He then moves on to Part II of the book: Cervantes' moment as a writer, the cultural context, the titles of both parts and the spurious Avellaneda's Quixote are commented upon.

In Part II there is a sense of the text being written and performed in the present because it incorporates current events, such as the expulsion of the moriscos, a critic of the arbitristas and a satire of the aristocracy. In part two of the Quixote Part I plays the role that the romances of chivalry played in Part I: the characters have read the first part and so a new larger mirror has been added to the play of mirrors that was already present. Characters evolve within a social context, which is consonant with the political character of the novel and has much to do with the development and evolution of realism in literature in the representation of every day life and of common people. An explanation of the Baroque aspects that appear in the second part of the novel helps to understand the Quixote as a whole and its relation with the first part.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The discussion of Don Quixote and Sancho about knight-errants and saints is not only about arms and letters, but about good actions for their own sake and for the sake of glory (or deceit). This discussion echoes the religious debates of the time and shows Don Quixote's broad knowledge of them, anticipating Part II's projection beyond Spain. The episode in El Toboso announces much of the mood of Part II with the darkness and the urban scenario. The lie of the enchanted Dulcinea is important because it will leave a deep imprint in the knight's subconscious and because it is the first episode in which the roles of Don Quixote and Sancho are reversed.

He proposes that the plot of the Quixote and some of the stories in part two unfold from deceit (enga\u00f1o) to disillusionment (desenga\u00f1o). He then turns his attention to Auerbach and Spitzer's essays included in the Casebook (\"Enchanted Dulcinea\" and \"Linguistic Perspectivism\" respectively) that try to describe what Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda calls the \"Cervantean,\" the particularities that define Cervantes' mind and style. In the second part of the lecture he comments on the episodes assigned for this week trying to explain their main characteristics and correspondence with part one. Doubting is common in Part II of the Quixote, suggesting that the characters meet with themselves to find meaning and identity. The lecture ends with the comments on one of Cervantes' Exemplary Stories, \"The Glass Graduate.\"\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Review: Enga\u00f1o and Desenga\u00f1o\r\n02:29 - Chapter 2.

                "lecture_description": "Cervantes' Don Quixote (SPAN 300)\r\n\r\nThe loose format of the Quixote allows for the incorporation of different stories and texts, such as the Camacho's wedding, which was going to be a play. The episode, a form of epithalamium based on the myth of Pyramus and Thisbe, states one of the main themes of part two, that art corrects nature. As a way of turning deceit, which would normally lead to disillusionment, into a happy ending, in Camacho's wedding episode art helps nature to attain good ending. Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda claims that in this episode there is a subtext in which marriage is not only a legal institution but also a transcendental metamorphosis of matter, or transubstantiation. The literal blending of bloods that makes marriage indivisible is echoed here through what Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda calls 'the itinerary of blood.' In the interpretation of the myth Cervantes resembles Vel\u00e1zquez in that they both show the inner recesses of representation: they show creation as a layered process that ultimately involves the real.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

                "lecture_description": "Cervantes' Don Quixote (SPAN 300)\r\n\r\nThis lecture covers two of the most important episodes of Part II of the Quixote: the descent into Montesinos cave and Master Peter's puppet show. The first one, on the one hand, engages the main literary topics and sources of the novel. Cervantes, by submitting Don Quixote's fantasies to natural law, questions the belief in the authenticity of the romances of chivalry and the reality of what his protagonist sees. The episode also provides a glimpse into the inner workings of Don Quixote's subconscious: his descent is a harsh look onto himself which, while not completely destroying his beliefs, weakens them seriously, and from now on he will act saner. Master Peter's puppet show introduces again Gin\u00e9s de Pasamonte, the character who represents the figure of the modern author in both parts of the novel. With Gin\u00e9s now disguised as a master puppeteer, Cervantes criticizes his contemporary playwright Lope de Vega, but most importantly, through the complex trompe-l'oeil that the puppet show constitutes, Cervantes analyzes the act of mimesis.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The second part adds (taken from the picaresque novel) geographic concreteness to its realistic portrayal of Spanish life and sociopolitical background to the novel: the episode of the boat shows the contrast between Don Quixote's Ptolemaic obsolete notions of geography and the new Copernican conception of an infinite universe. The duke and duchess represent the Spanish idle upper classes in debt and kept financially afloat through loans, like the Spanish Crown. Don Quijote's debate with the ecclesiastic is a critique of the Church, not of religion. The hunt in the wood was a reproduction of a leisure activity, a sport. The pageant in the forest is a baroque perversion of Dante's Purgatorio (XXVIII-XXX). Dulcinea as a transvestite seems to represent a burlesque manifestation of Don Quijote's repressed inner desire.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

In the episode of the afflicted matron, the story about Countess Trifaldi, and Clavile\u00f1o, we see these expansions (the presence of love and death, the black color, the monsters, the clashing elements, the cross-dressing, the grotesque, the inclusiveness) which reach the limits of representation, in consonance with baroque aesthetics. The increasing presence of Virgil and to the Aeneid seem to point out that Don Quixote's task is somewhat equivalent to that of Aeneas, but Don Quixote's pursuit is not to found Rome, but to conquer himself. In part one we learned to look for the story behind the story, now, with all the pranks and stories made up by the duke's steward, we learn how a story is made.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The protagonist's change started with Sancho's enchantment of Dulcinea, and peaked in the cave of Montesinos. Now, he displays his deepened wisdom in the counsel to his squire on how to govern the island of Barataria. The good government of Sancho, together with the fact that the cleverest character in the second part is the steward, reflects a crumbling society: Barataria is related to the breakdown of aristocratic authority and the emergence of the common man as potential ruler. The island, too, like a mock Utopia, is a laboratory of fiction making, in which the steward, who is the author, ironically gets trapped. In a very baroque like inversion, Sancho and Don Quixote endure all the pranks from the duke and duchess with their dignity untouched, proving that the mockers are the ones finally mocked.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The first one is improvisation, as we see it in the confluence of actual geography with current historical events: the expulsion of the moriscos, and the Turkish and Huguenots menaces. With the story of Ricote, a kind of morisco novel in a nutshell, Cervantes provides a smorgasbord of narrative possibilities, and presents the consequences that political decisions have on common people. The second issue is the international dimension that the novel acquires with the episode of Roque Guinard and the entrance in Barcelona. The third issue is the influence that art or literature has on reality: the prank organized by the duke and duchess makes possible the marriage of due\u00f1a Rodr\u00edguez's daughter. Fiction, Cervantes seems to be suggesting, affects reality and improves it. Finally, Sancho's fall into the pit, a parody of the episode of his master in the cave of Montesinos, makes the squire an equal to Don Quixote as the novel progresses.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

In the episodes in Barcelona, the prank with the talking head makes literal the figure of prosopopeia; Don Quixote's visit to the printing shop explores the very origin of the book; the sign the boys hang on Don Quixote's back also reduces him to language. Avellaneda's misreading of the Quixote coincides with that of the due\u00f1as who punish Sancho, and is also ironically represented in Altisidora's dream. By taking literature to its limits, by incorporating Avellaneda's book into the Quixote, by rejecting bookish knowledge in favor of experience, Cervantes seems to point to the idea that there is no position from which to stand outside of the world of fiction. The only way out would be through a voluntary act of the will, equivalent to the one Don Quixote makes after being defeated by the Knight of the White Moon.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

He starts referring to Cervantes' humor, which allows us to see humanity in contrast to the mad hero and thus appreciate everyone's folly. The novel's plot, with Don Quixote's repeated returns home, suggests that life consists of going and coming back, and this is probably why we approach the end by returning to the beginning. In his last return home Don Quixote has conquered himself. By accepting his defeat by the Knight of the White Moon, who is a reflection of himself, he accepts himself for what he is. In the process of returning, Cervantes has underlined that reality has become fictionalized in Part II independently of Don Quixote. Cervantes is aware that his hero, as we see in Sancho's comments at the last inn, belongs to the great fictions of the ages. The Quixote closes in three ways, corresponding to a three-part conception of the worlds in which Don Quixote lives: Don Quixote is defeated; he regains his sanity; and he dies. Death is necessary in the novel, as it is a form of closure that everyone understands.

                "lecture_description": "Cervantes' Don Quixote (SPAN 300)\r\n\r\nWould have Cervantes deserved such recognition, had he not written the Quixote? The answer is no. However, he would probably be remembered for some of his other works. Two of The Exemplary Stories, significantly connected together, are commented in this lecture. \"The Deceitful Marriage\" deconstructs marriage both as a social institution and as a narrative tool: Cervantes manipulates literary conventions by beginning with what is normally the end of a story, a marriage, and works backwards to undue a union that never took place legitimately. In \"The Dogs Colloquy\" we skirt the supernatural idea that dogs can talk. The story is a picaresque autobiography in which the p\u00edcaro pretends to be a dog. Perhaps Scipio's life, not told here, could have been another Quixote. The author of a story, it is suggested, does not control the text while it is being read. A short comment on Kafka's parable \"The Truth about Sancho Panza\" and Borges' story Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote precede the end of this last lecture that refers to Cervantes' death. Drawing a parallel between Cervantes' death and that of Don Quixote and Alonso Quijano, Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda reads the dedication to Persiles and Cervantes', and also his own, farewell to this course.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Professor Dimock examines a cluster of three vignettes from In Our Time to show how Hemingway's laconic style naturalizes problems of pain and violence amidst the ethnic tensions of the American Midwest. Drawing on the theoretical writings of critics Elaine Scarry and Susan Sontag, and the artistic representations of painter Edvard Munch, Professor Dimock shows how language probes the empathetic boundaries of communal suffering in \"Indian Camp\" and \"Chapter II.\" She concludes with a discussion of \"The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife\" that shows how inter-ethnic conflict between Native Americans and whites is neutralized by the primitive impulse of peacekeeping, the opposite of the violence she reads in the two other vignettes in this cluster. \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Professor Dimock reads this anger as a harbinger of the modern condition: a threatening world in which strangers and impersonality reign supreme. In her reading, she shows Faulkner expressing qualified sympathy for Jason, whose loss of a utopian model of community is represented with sadness and pathos in the final sections of the novel. \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Luster and Dilsey's centrality to the final section of the novel, particularly their interactions with the Reverent Shegog on Easter Sunday, transform The Sound and the Fury into a story of redemption; they reconstitute a sense of community whose loss is mourned in Jason's section. Professor Dimock concludes by reading the final scene of section four -- Jason's taking over of the horse Queenie from Luster's control -- as Jason's brief and heroic redemption, the only respite that Faulkner grants Jason in the course of the novel.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Once this macro history is established, she reads the narrative techniques of As I Lay Dying through two analytic lenses. First, she draws on Bakhtin's notion of social dialects to underscore the language that indexes poor whites as a Southern type. Second, she marshals Frank Kermode's idea of narrative secrecy to show how two secrets in As I Lay Dying -- Dewey Dell's illegitimate pregnancy and Jewel's illegitimate birth -- are gradually revealed to the reader through Faulkner's multiple narrators, each a speaker of a socially codified dialect, and each a practitioner of narrative secrecy in his or her own right.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

As Addie Bundren's monologue reveals, Jewel's illegitimate father, the Reverend Whitfield, is similarly identified with both the horse, as the animal he rides, and the snake, whose Edenic behavior he parallels in his affair with Addie. \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

She juxtaposes his invocations of Paris and Missouri to the rooted communities of the guerillas, and reads analogies of racial and ethnic conflict -- specifically, the references to the Moors in Spain and persecuted blacks in America -- as a point of tension, an ironic commentary on the coexistence of the distant home and the on-site environment. She concludes with a reading of the American Civil War as a temporally distant home which Jordan tries to recuperate in the present moment of European conflict. \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Professor Dimock concludes by observing the kinship between the dual narratives of Lena Grove and Joe Christmas as, respectively, the undramatic and dramatic strands of the novel.

They acquire energy from water vapor in the atmosphere over land and therefore typically require warm air temperatures and high humidity.  Hurricanes gain energy from water vapor evaporated from the ocean surface.  This requires warm ocean temperatures, and is the reason hurricanes weaken over land.  Hurricanes are cyclonic and therefore also require a non-zero Coriolis force to form and maintain their structure.  For this reason they cannot form over the equator and cannot cross the equator.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Coriolis Force Sign Reversal\r\n01:17 - Chapter 2. Convective Storms\r\n02:52 - Chapter 3.

Both types of currents are forced remotely rather than locally.  Wind driven currents are initially forced by the wind stress causing water to pile up in certain locations.  This produces a pressure gradient, which is then balanced by the Coriolis force and geostrophic currents develop.  The gyre circulations found in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are wind driven currents.  There is a connection between the physics of these currents and the biological productivity in the ocean.  For example, productivity is greatest in areas of equatorial and coastal upwelling as nutrient rich deep water is brought to the sunlit surface. \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

It is composed of two extreme states, El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a.  The oscillation between these states can be seen in measurements of sea surface temperature (SST), sea level pressure, thermocline depth, and easterly trade wind strength.  Changes in SST and pressure lead to shifting of convective activity across the equatorial Pacific.  Changes in the strength of the easterly trade winds lead to changes in the depth of the thermocline, which affect coastal upwelling offshore of South America.  If upwelling is reduced, primary productivity is also reduced.  The effect of ENSO on atmospheric  convection and coastal upwelling makes it an important factor for both agriculture and fishing industries.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Ice sheets form on land and are composed of compacted snow that has accumulated over time.  Ice sheets spread over a land surface and can reach the ocean.  If the ice continuity is maintained when the ice sheet reaches the ocean, the ice will float on the water and this is referred to as an ice shelf.  Icebergs are large chunks of glaciers that break off into the ocean.  They can become grounded in shallow water, but generally are moved by the wind and ocean currents.

The carbon cycle describes the reservoirs of carbon (atmosphere, terrestrial biomass and ocean) and the exchanges that occur between these reservoirs.  Inputs of carbon to the atmosphere include burning of fossil fuels and respiration from biomass.  Vegetation also removes carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, and a similar uptake of carbon from the atmosphere occurs in the ocean through biological processes.  Residence time for carbon in the atmosphere can be computed and is estimated to be a few hundred years.

Still, some significant changes in temperature and sea level did occur.  These climatic fluctuations include the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, and more recently global warming.  Temperature data for the 20th century shows a strong warming from about 1970 to the present day, typically associated with anthropogenic forcing including greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions.  Volcanic eruptions also caused slight variations in the climate during the 20th century (e.g. Pinatubo in 1991).  Aerosols released during a volcanic eruption are quickly distributed around the globe and act to increase the atmospheric albedo and block solar radiation.  Therefore volcanic eruption signatures in climate data appear as short term decreases in temperature.  General circulation models have been used to simulate the climate of the 20th century using both natural and anthropogenic climate forcings.  These models indicate that anthropogenic forcings are likely responsible for the most recent rise in temperature.    \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

There are several different climate sensitivities that take into account different feedbacks in the climate system.  The simplest climate sensitivity is black body sensitivity, which does not account for any feedbacks but gives the temperature change resulting just from a change in radiative forcing.  The calculated climate sensitivity based only on the Stefan-Boltzmann Law is lower than the climate sensitivity calculated using both temperature data over the last 100 years and ice age data over the last ~200,000 years, indicating that feedbacks have played a role in climate sensitivity.  World population is also discussed, with population trends outlined for various countries as well as trends associated with developing areas versus developed areas. The issue of sustainable population is introduced.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Actions that May Reduce Global Warming\r\n02:03 - Chapter 2. Future Climate Research\r\n07:13 - Chapter 3.

Tropospheric ozone in the form of photochemical smog is sometimes dangerously high whereas stratospheric ozone concentration is sometimes dangerously low.  Photochemical smog is created through chemical reactions between UV radiation from the run and nitrogen oxides that are emitted from automobiles.  High concentrations of tropospheric ozone are dangerous because of the damage ozone can cause to a person's airway if it is inhaled.  The EPA has specified limits of ozone concentration but several counties in the USA exceed these limits.  The primary air pollutants from which ozone is created have a peak concentration twice a day typically, which is associated with rush hour times during the day.  \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Energy is primarily used for heating, transportation, and generating electricity.  Coal is burned largely to produce electricity and is a major contributor to air pollution with coal power plants emitting carbon dioxides and nitrous oxides.  Another major resource used for energy is oil.  It is projected that each country either has reached or will reach a peak oil use, after which oil use will decrease.  Natural gas is now being obtained from shale using the extraction technique of fracting which is a recent discovery.  Nuclear power gained popularity worldwide through the 1970s, however very few new power plants have been built in the last three decades following the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl episodes.  Hydroelectric power is generated by forcing water flowing from high terrain through a turbine to produce electricity.  There are many hydroelectric dams operating globally.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

These include wind energy, solar energy, biomass energy and geothermal energy.  Energy from wind is acquired through the use of large wind turbines.  These turbines ideally need to be located in areas where there is strong wind and low atmospheric turbulence.  Solar power is collected using both photovoltaic solar cells and concentrated solar power.    Energy from biomass can be produced in two ways: burning biomass to generate electricity or fermentation to produce fuel ethanol.  Geothermal energy is produced by pumping water below the earth's surface into areas of hot rocks which heats the water and creates steam.  This steam is then run through a turbine to produce power.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Renewable Energy Sources\r\n02:20 - Chapter 2. Wind Energy\r\n35:19 - Chapter 3. Solar Power\r\n42:18 - Chapter 4.

For Open Yale Courses we present only one of these labs; the Quinnipiac River Field Trip.  This field trip introduces the students to the part of the hydrologic cycle where precipitation over the continent returns to the oceans in rivers. During a two-hour tour, we visited five sites along the Quinnipiac River observing temperature, salinity and streamflow. In addition, water samples were taken and later analyzed for dissolved cations. From direct observation, the role of river discharge and tidal phase is identified. From the cation data, issues of water mixing, ocean salinity and the calcium budget of the ocean are discussed. The Quinnipiac River Field Trip is related to several lectures in the course such as lectures 9, 10 and 11 (Water in the Atmosphere); 15, 16 and 17 (Climate and Seasons); and 20 (Ocean Salinity).\r\n\r\nComplete course materials are available at the Open Yale Courses website: http://oyc.yale.edu\r\n\r\nThis course was recorded in Fall 2011.",

        "course_description": "Freshman Organic Chemistry II (CHEM 125B)\r\n\r\nThis second semester of Freshman Organic Chemistry builds on the first semester's treatment of molecular structure and energy* to discuss how reaction mechanisms have been discovered and understood.  It also treats the spectroscopy and synthesis of organic molecules.  Reactions and their rates can be understood in terms of reaction-coordinate diagrams involving the passage of a set of atoms through the \"transition state\" on the potential-energy surface.  Analysis of bond-dissociation energies suggests a chain mechanism for free-radical halogenation of alkanes.

Fractional kinetic orders suggest dissociation of a dominant aggregate to give a smaller reactive species.  An apparent negative kinetic order, due to competition with a second-order process, leads to spontaneous deracemization of chiral crystals.  Changes in bond dissociation energies can be due to differences in bonds or in radicals.  Although it is often said that the order of alkyl radical stability is tertiary, secondary, primary, careful analysis suggests that the order of bond dissociation energies may be due to differences in the alkanes rather than in the radicals.  Hammond helped organic chemists begin to think systematically about predicting relative reaction rates by suggesting that the transition states of more exothermic reactions should lie closer to the starting materials in structure and energy.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Additon to alkenes can involve free-radical, metal-catalyzed, and stepwise electrophilic mechanisms, the last via a cation intermediate. Electrostatics can help position an attacking electrophile like H+, but bonding en route to Markovnikov addition requires orbital mixing to form the more stable cation.  Relative cation stability can be understood in terms of hyperconjugation, hybridization, and solvation or polarizability. Stabilization of a carbocation via methide shift can compete with its trapping by solvent.  The curious relative rates in stepwise addition of HCl or HBr to alkynes show that halogen substituents are both electron withdrawing and electron donating.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Similarly a reagent that attacks both alkene carbons simultaneously by providing a nucleophilic component during electrophilic attack can avoid rearrangement, as in reactions that proceed via three-membered-ring halonium intermediates.  Simultaneity in making two bonds during formation of cyclopropanes from carbenes can be demonstrated using stereochemistry.  Anti-Markovnikov hydration can be achieved via hydroboration followed by oxidation with hydroperoxide. Rearrangement of the borane hydroperoxide intermediate with frontside C-O bond formation shows close orbital analogy to backside attack during SN2 substitution. Again syn-addition shows that nucleophilic attack occurs simultaneously with electrophilic attack on the alkene. \r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The ozonolysis of alkenes begins with several 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions that can be understood in terms of matching HOMOs with LUMOs of the corresponding symmetry.  The process continues with acetal hydrolysis and either reduction or oxidation to obtain the desired product.  Mechanisms of these typical reactions are analyzed.  Although addition to the C=O double bond is usually considered nucleophilic, it can have an important electrophilic component that makes it mechanistically analogous to the \"electrophilic\" additions to C=C being discussed in these lectures.

Coupling such oxidative additions to reductive eliminations, provides a low-energy catalytic path for addition of H2 to an alkene. Such catalytic hydrogenation is often said to involve syn stereochemistry, but the primary literature shows that addition can be anti when allylic rearrangement occurs on the catalyst.  Similar oxidative/reductive cycles operate in olefin metathesis and metal-catalyzed polymerization. Careful catalyst design allows control over polymer stereochemistry (tacticity).

Mixing 1s with 2p causes a vibration that can absorb or generate light, while mixing 1s with 2s causes \"breathing\" that does not interact with light. Many natural organic chromophores involve mixing an unshared electron pair with a vacant pi orbital, whose conjugation determines color.  Infrared spectra reveal atomic vibration frequencies, which are related by Hooke's law to bond strengths and \"reduced\" masses.  Infrared spectra are complicated by the coupling of local oscillators of similar frequency to give \"normal\" modes.

Dependence of the signal intensity on relaxation allows BOLD functional MRI that shows brain activity.  When the applied magnetic field is sufficiently uniform, chemical NMR spectra differentiate proton signals according to local field variations within molecules.  Modern research in a chemical laboratory like Yale's depends on the availability of many magnetic resonance spectrometers.

The chemical shift can be sensitive to electrons orbiting elsewhere if the amount of orbiting varies with molecular orientation.  This \"diamagnetic anisotropy\" is commonly used to rationalize the unusual chemical shifts of protons in acetylene and in aromatic and antiaromatic compounds.  The other source of a proton's local field is nearby magnetic nuclei, which can be counted by the splitting multiplicity.  Unlike chemical shift, which is measured in fractional units because it depends on the strength of the applied field, this spin-spin splitting (J), measured in Hz, is dependent only on molecular structure.  J depends not on spatial proximity, but on orbital overlap, which, remarkably, is larger for anti- than for eclipsed conformations.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Since the spectroscopic time scale depends on frequency differences, averaging is easier in NMR than in IR.

Evidence from 1970 shows that Friedel-Crafts propylation involves an SN2 mechanism, not a protonated cyclopropane.  Assigning oxidation states from -4 to +4 to the carbon atoms of proposed starting material and product allows choosing whether a reagent that is oxidizing or reducing or neither is appropriate. Beyond belonging to the appropriate redox class, the reagent must have an appropriate mechanism.  Alcohol oxidations by elemental bromine and by Cr+6 reagents are shown to involve familiar substitution, elimination, and addition mechanisms. Mechanistic understanding allows adjusting conditions to make oxidation selective.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Exam Question on NMR, Color, and Triphenylmethyl Dimerization\r\n11:15 - Chapter 2.

One of mankind's great accomplishments was determinining its constitution and especially its configuration before such spectroscopy.  By 1887 Heinrich Kiliani had established the constitution of glucose as an aldohexose, and with help from Emil Fischer, he developed a method for homologating aldoses. Fisher assembled a great deal of experimental evidence on interconversion of natural and artificial aldoses, and their derivatives, especially their crystalline osazones.  In 1892 he used this evidence to prove logically which of eight aldohexose configurations corresponds to glucose and to provide definitive support for van't Hoff's stereochemical theory. In 1991 Cram, Tanner, and Thomas reported the NMR spectrum of antiaromatic cyclobutadiene, which they prepared by photolysis inside a clamshell molecule that they designed and constructed in order to isolate this highly reactive molecule.\r\n\r\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Following this, he calls upon three guest instrumentalists on French horn, bassoon, and viola to give a brief performance-introduction to each instrument. He concludes the session with a discussion of acoustics, focusing on the concept of partials, and then brings the lecture to a close with commentary on Richard Strauss's tone-poem, Death and Transfiguration.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The class is then taught the basics of rhythmic dictation -- skill that entails notating the rhythm of a piece after listening to it.

He discusses the Civil War, focusing specifically on the Emancipation Proclamation and the Conscription Acts of 1863. Professor Holloway spends the duration of the lecture focusing on the labor and racial tensions that led to the New York City draft riots and their aftermath. The crucible of the Civil War, he argues, gives a very clear picture of what it means to be a citizen and what it means to be American. Professor Holloway then gives specific examples of how citizenship was linked to freedom, how freedom was linked to race, and how the tensions between these linkages produced extreme violence.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

It was far from clear, however, which plan would do a better job maintaining the social peace and protecting African Americans' ability to earn a wage, raise a family, own land, and exercise the right to vote. In this lecture, Professor Holloway outlines the contours of the Ten Percent Plan, Presidential Reconstruction, and Radical Reconstruction, and he explains how these plans embraced a variety of approaches to reuniting the disparate states. As Professor Holloway explains, Reconstruction greatly enhanced the rights of African Americans, while also circumscribing their lives by new political, economic, and social initiatives.\n\nWarning: This lecture contains graphic content and/or adult language that some users may find disturbing.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

In the second half of the lecture, Professor Holloway focuses on the ideas of civilization and manliness, lynchings, and anti-lynching campaigns.

Historians often refer to this era as the \"nadir,\" the lowest point, in the post-Emancipation black experience. But, as Professor Holloway explains in this lecture, the oppressive realities of black life did not silence the most dedicated black activists. During this time, a new generation of black political and intellectual leaders, including Alexander Crummell, Anna Julia Cooper, and W. E. B. Du Bois, dedicated themselves to \"uplifting\" blacks politically, economically, and morally.

The accommodationists, like Booker T. Washington, believed that the quickest way to improve the quality of black life was to forge a social peace with powerful whites, temporarily accepting the continued separation of the races and advocating vocational education as a pragmatic way for blacks to improve their lives. Opposed to Washington were people like Anna Julia Cooper and W.E.B. Du Bois who embraced assimilation and saw higher education as the cure-all to racialized problems. Du Bois, in particular, is famous for his assertion that it would be the \"Talented Tenth\" of the race who would lead blacks to a better life.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

During this time, black Americans relocated from the rural South to the urban North. This general shift in the population marked a moment of self-determination for African Americans, demonstrating that they were prepared to leave behind the lives they had made in the South for better opportunities elsewhere. It is important to see these migrations as a form of social protest against the limited political and economic opportunity in the South, racial violence, and the KKK, which was reborn and flourished in the early 1920s. As Professor Holloway reveals, urban life in the North was frequently cruel and often difficult, but it was also a life forged of free will and absent a regional and cultural history of forced bondage. The remainder of the lecture focuses on how whites' racial anxieties were manifested in the cultural realm, using D.W.

                "lecture_description": "American History: From Emancipation to the Present (AFAM 162)\n\nIn this lecture, Professor Holloway expands our understanding of \"The Great Migration\" by looking at what happens when African Americans settled in Northern and Midwestern cities. He examines the 1917 East St. Louis race riot, the 1919 Chicago race riot, and the NAACP's Silent Protest Parade from New York City's Fifth Avenue to Harlem. The second portion of the lecture is on African American soldiers' experiences abroad during World War, their rising expectations for citizenship rights when they return, the new militancy that they espoused, and the racial backlash against them by whites. Black soldiers, returning to the U.S. after risking their lives in war, were lynched in uniform. Responding to this backlash, Professor Holloway shows how civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois and poet Claude McKay foreshadowed the new political climate in which African Americans would assert their rights.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1. W.E.B.

The New Negro ideology was articulated on a wide scale after World War I, when the promises of democracy at home went unfulfilled. Marcus Garvey best articulated this new consciousness through his Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), the first organized grassroots mass protest movement in African American history. Garvey advocated black pride and autonomy, worked to build a great steam line so blacks could partake in nation-building, and helped dispirited blacks dream of an eventual return to Africa. Garvey's ability to realize his dreams was limited by his own organizational ineptitude and by the federal government's systematic attempts to infiltrate and then destroy the UNIA. The lecture ends with an examination of Garvey's relationships to other black leaders, including Father Divine and his Peace Mission Movement.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

In this lecture, Professor Holloway documents some of the expressions of the Harlem Renaissance (also known as the New Negro Renaissance), the political and cultural movement that claimed Harlem as its figurative capital. In fact, thousands of African Americans flocked to Harlem, and it became the center of a rich cultural and political environment--one always fraught with complications, but still understood to represent the best that black America had to offer. As Professor Holloway shows, white enthusiasts of these newly-admired cultural forms visited Harlem to get a taste of black life. Indeed, without the financial support of the white community, whatever cultural efflorescence that did exist in Harlem would have been significantly less grand. Yet the tensions between white patrons and black artists, as well as between black intellectuals and black artists, made the Harlem Renaissance a complex movement.\n\nWarning: This lecture contains graphic content and/or adult language that some users may find disturbing.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

In this lecture, Professor Holloway looks at the Great Depression and the federal government's responses to it, including the New Deal's impact on African Americans, both materially and symbolically. As the federal government openly courted their favor, African Americans organized various political groups to monitor federal activities. In the second portion of the lecture, Professor Holloway examines the achievements of the Black Cabinet, the injustices of the Scottsboro Boys' case, and the efficacy of the \"Don't Buy Where You Can't Work\" campaigns, led in Washington, D.C., by the New Negro Alliance. As much as the 1930s were about retrenchment for African Americans, they also reflected new political possibilities and new forms of political expression within black America. Thus, as Professor Holloway reveals, the roots of the modern civil rights movement are all part and parcel of New Deal America.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

He focuses on the National Negro Congress, the Marian Anderson Easter Sunday Concert, and the March on Washington movement. These examples reveal the diverse strategies and organizing methods employed during this era, as the federal government learned that it could not afford to ignore black leaders the way it had since the founding of the Republic. Professor Holloway also examines the radical possibilities of this decade, as black Communists and Socialists advanced democratic visions for the country. For a brief moment, these ideas appeared to have traction. Yet as the Cold War marched on, charges of communism would decimate some African American civil rights groups.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

A critical survey of the histories behind such famous events as the desegregation of the Armed Forces, the formation of the Congress on Racial Equality (CORE), the elimination of the all-white primary, and the Supreme Court's Brown decision demonstrate how complicated the story of the civil rights movement is. Professor Holloway canvasses events on the high political stage as well as in the legal arena to understand the fundamental shift, taking place in the country on racial issues. An examination of civil rights organizing practices and legal strategies in the 1940s, in particular, helps provide a framework for re-periodizing the movement.\n\nWarning: This lecture contains graphic content and/or adult language that some users may find disturbing.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

But in this lecture, Professor Holloway asks: what of the other activists in the struggle? What of the other organizations involved in the struggle? And what of the history of the struggle before King reluctantly emerged on the scene? By uncovering the histories of the Montgomery bus boycott, the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, the death of Emmett Till, the Greensboro student sit-ins, and the formation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, one finds differing responses to violence and multiple approaches to attacking racial bias and discrimination. Professor Holloway also draws attention to the gender dynamics of the civil rights movement by considering the inner-workings of the Women's Political Council in Montgomery, Alabama, the original motivating force behind the 1955 bus boycott, and the great importance of respectability to the movement. This lecture reveals that there was no single civil rights movement, that there were many activists working in a variety of different ways and with varying degrees of success, and that King was a complicated figure, both inspiring and stifling activism.\n\nWarning: This lecture contains graphic content and/or adult language that some users may find disturbing.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Though King's message and delivery are precious moments in this nation's history, and excerpts are familiar to virtually all American school children, King's opinion of society and its remedy have been frozen in time and reduced to a few moments of his famous speech. Professor Holloway frees King from his magnificent yet soothing speech in order to appreciate the real world political and social battles that defined his life and the lives of those who fought beside him in the struggle for freedom and equality. By shedding light on moments that have been dropped out of the \"master narrative\" of the civil rights movement, Professor Holloway demonstrates that the movement was far from reaching a moment of transcendence at the 1963 March on Washington.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

In the final year of his life, prior to his assassination by NOI members in 1965, Malcolm X makes a religious journey to Mecca, rejects his prior views on race, starts the Organization of Afro-American Unity, and adopts the name El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz.

By examining the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party's quest to seat alternate delegates at the Democratic National Convention in 1964; \"Bloody Sunday\" and the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery; the signing of the 1965 Voting Rights Act; and the riots that summer in Watts, a poor neighborhood in Los Angeles, Professor Holloway reveals that people were struggling with the new tactical change in the movement. The militancy seen in Watts was becoming more recognizable and more frequent, partially due to rhetoric but also do to the increasing U.S. military occupation in Vietnam. Impatience was growing not just in urban or northern areas, but all over the country. In the final portion of the lecture, Professor Holloway offers a preview of the first Black Panther Party, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, founded in Lowndes County, Mississippi, and the shifting racial philosophy of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, led by Stokely Carmichael.\n\nWarning: This lecture contains graphic content and/or adult language that some users may find disturbing.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

In this lecture, Professor Holloway uncovers the history of black radicalism in the sixties, most famously embodied by the Black Panther Party, and reveals how black power encompassed a call for race pride, the development of black-run organizations dedicated to saving black communities, and also a fascination with an image--one conferred upon black radicals by whites as well as consciously cultivated by African Americans. At the same time, this hyper-masculine, cool, soulful, and dangerous aesthetic obscured some of the important work that the black militants tried to accomplish. In the second half of this lecture, Professor Holloway reveals how groups like the Black Panthers created their own community social welfare programming and maintained links between their cause and that of oppressed people around the world.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Yet for every moment of great promise, there was a moment of great confusion and despair. In this lecture, Professor Holloway traces the competing lines of activism, change, struggle, frustration, and political brinksmanship that occurred in the late sixties. He focuses on SNCC's trajectory, Martin Luther King's poverty campaign in Chicago, his views on Vietnam, the riots that followed his 1968 assassination, and the Poor People's Campaign. The remainder of the lecture focuses on the national and international events of 1968 that contributed to this feeling of unrest sweeping the country. As the movement grew beyond its traditional boundaries, the moral and psychological hold it had on America began to lose its strength. As Professor Holloway explains, by the end of the 1960s, it seemed that Americans cared little for the larger and more complicated truths pointed to by black radicals' political, social, economic, and cultural critique.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

In this lecture, Professor Holloway canvasses some of the political turmoil of this era and the ways that it was reflected in popular culture. By examining musical achievements like Marvin Gaye's album, What's Going On?, and some of Stevie Wonder's songs recorded around this time, it becomes clear that black cultural producers were wrestling with Vietnam, economic despair, ecological despair, poverty, and urban decay. Yet the early 1970s was also a moment of black cultural celebration, and Professor Holloway explores the complicated messages about black sexuality in general, and black masculinity and the role of black women in specific, depicted in blaxploitation films like Shaft, Sweet Sweetback's Badasssss Song, Super Fly, and Foxy Brown.\n\nWarning: This lecture contains graphic content and/or adult language that some users may find disturbing.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

But in this lecture, Professor Holloway examines moments of hope for black political organization, including Carl Stokes's 1967 mayoral victory in Cleveland, the formation of the Congressional Black Caucus in 1969, and the 1972 National Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana. Yet for all of the coalition building taking place, deeper problems revolved around gender. In this lecture, Professor Holloway focuses specifically on the difficulties that black women encountered as they confronted a racist and sexist political system, exemplified by Daniel Patrick Moynihan's concern over women-headed households in black America. When Shirley Chisholm declared her candidacy for the presidency, and when women on the ground, like Johnnie Tillman, fought for welfare rights or tried to join the modern feminist movement, they faced their \"double jeopardy,\" that is a second-class status rooted in both racial and gender oppression. Although the early 1970s certainly was not the first time black women began to speak up about their oppression, Professor Holloway reveals that they finally began to be heard, and they formed groups, like the National Black Feminist Organization and the Combahee River Collective, to try to change the national conversation.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Professor Holloway traces Jackson's ascension into Martin Luther King's inner-circle, his work in Chicago with Operation Breadbasket and then later with Operation PUSH, his reaction to King's assassination, his national economic boycotts, and his 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns. In the second half of the lecture, Professor Holloway turns to the national stage, surveying the political and social milieu around President Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan's administrations, focusing specifically on the latter two. While Jimmy Carter diversified the executive branch of the federal government through White House appointments, Ronald Reagan had a more covert approach to racial politics. By claiming that the federal government was the real problem, and calling for a return to states' rights, Reagan implicitly supported the centralizing power of racists like Bull Connor and organizations like the KKK. Thus, Professor Holloway explains, as public race baiting fell out of favor, conservatives like Reagan adopted a way of talking about race without ever mentioning it.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

An examination of the political rhetoric from the George H.W. Bush/Michael Dukakis campaign, including the infamous Willie Horton advertisement, as well as racially-infused persons and incidents such as Bernhard Goetz, the \"Subway Vigilante;\" Charles Stuart; the Central Park jogger case; Senator Jesse Helms's \"Angry Hands\" advertisement; the murder of Latasha Harlins by Soon Ja Du, a Korean shopkeeper; the Rodney King beating; and the riots and rebellion in South Central, Los Angeles following the acquittal of the white policemen who beat him all reveal the special coding that linked people's awareness of race and crime and the ways that the media reinforced the stereotype that crime was the special province of the black male.

Professor Holloway discusses Bill Clinton's policies in particular, honing in on his ability to connect with the African American community, the controversy surrounding Lani Guinier's cabinet appointment, and his National Dialogue on Race. He then turns to California to examine the passage of Propositions 187 and 209, which begin to call into question common notions about civil rights legislation and affirmative action in our nation. In the remainder of the lecture, Professor Holloway talks about four landmark court cases--Shaw v. Reno, Adarand v. Pena, Hopwood v. Texas, and Grutter v.

The final two questions he grapples with are 1) what does it mean to be \"post-racial\" and 2) how is race used in our society? In order to propose answers to these questions, Professor Holloway examines Barack Obama's election; his 2008 inauguration; and his speech, \"A More Perfect Union,\" given during the campaign. He also provides some examples of the ways raced is used in the American landscape to distract attention from class and gender; to sell products, including Uncle Ben's rice and Aunt Jemima's pancakes; to suggest a progressive commitment to equality; to draw in tourist money; and to heighten emotions, as illustrated by some of the ways that New Orleans' residents were depicted during Hurricane Katrina. In the end, Professor Holloway argues that race is used in ways that are, whether intentionally or by accident, at best simplistic and at worst destructive, often because we are unwilling to talk or think about these issues in complicated ways. He then leaves the students with one final question: how will you use race?\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1. Introduction and Synthesizing Material Covered So Far\n12:39 - Chapter 2.

Drawing from and critiquing the work of Yehezkel Kaufmann, the lecture compares the religion of the Hebrew Bible with the cultures of the Ancient Near East. Two models of development are discussed: an evolutionary model of development in which the Hebrew Bible is continuous with Ancient Near Eastern culture and a revolutionary model of development in which the Israelite religion is radically discontinuous with Ancient Near Eastern culture. At stake in this debate is whether the religion of the Hebrew Bible is really the religion of ancient Israel.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Micah attacks the doctrine of the inviolability of Zion and employs the literary form of a covenant lawsuit (or riv) in his denunciation of the nation. Several short prophetic books are also discussed: Zephaniah; the Book of Nahum, depicting the downfall of Assyria and distinguished for its vivid poetic style; and the book of Habbakuk, which contains philosophical musings on God's behavior.

What was the meaning of this event and how could such tremendous evil and suffering be reconciled with the nature of God himself? Professor Hayes shows how Israel's prophets attempted to answer this question, turning the nation's defeat and despair into an occasion for renewing faith in Israel's God. The lecture continues with an in-depth study of the book of Ezekiel. Ezekiel's denunciations of Jerusalem are among the most lurid and violent in the Bible and he concludes that destruction is the only possible remedy. Ezekiel's visions include God's withdrawal from Jerusalem to be with his people in exile, and his ultimate return. Ezekiel's use of dramatic prophetic signs, his rejection of collective divine punishment and assertion of individual responsibility are discussed. The last part of the lecture turns to Second Isaiah and the famous \"servant songs\" that find a universal significance in Israel's suffering.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Proverbs reinforces the Deuteronomistic idea of divine retributive justice according to which the good prosper and the evil are punished.

Another poetic book of the Bible is the Song of Songs, an erotic work the sexually explicit content of which has been piously reinterpreted over the centuries. The second half of the lecture turns to the period of the Restoration when the Judean exiles returned to what was now the province of Yehud under Cyrus, the Persian ruler. The books of 1 and 2 Chronicles refer to some of the events of this time as well as the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Ezra and Nehemiah are said to renew the Mosaic covenant with the Torah at its center, and to institute a number of social and religious reforms (including a universal ban on intermarriage that will ultimately fail) in order to consolidate the struggling community.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

The poem \"A Grave\" is presented as characteristic of the prose rhythms and discursive manner of Moore's poems, including their use of expository language without meter or rhyme. The poem \"England\" is read as a defense of American culture, in opposition to the Eurocentricism of Eliot, Pound, and other modernists. In the poem \"An Octopus,\" Moore makes use of excerpts from pamphlets and other unusual prose sources to suggest that inspiration is not limited to any one voice or to literary models.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Selections from Elizabeth Bishop's personal memoir of Moore are presented with special attention to Moore's relationships with other modernists and male poets in particular. The poem \"To a Snail\" is considered as a meditation on style and compression, and a reading of \"The Paper Nautilus\" rounds out a wider examination of the use and meaning of restraint in Moore's poetry.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Bishop's \"Visits to St. Elizabeth's\" is considered as a formal rebuke to the ambitions of modernism alongside Auden's statement that \"poetry makes nothing happen\" but ultimately the two poets are shown to offer poetry as a solution to modern alienation in its capacity to renew human community through communication.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.
